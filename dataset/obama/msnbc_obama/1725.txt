Speaking at the annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Obama said that at a time of bitter partisanship, lawmakers must find a way to be open to the ideas of others, while staying true to their core principles."I pray that God will show me and all of us the limits of our understanding and open our ears and our hearts to our brothers and sisters with different points of view, that such reminders of our shared hopes and our shared dreams and our shared limitations as children of God will reveal a way forward that we can travel together," he said.Giffords's husband, Mark Kelly, attended Thursday's breakfast."We are with them for the long haul, and God is with them for the long haul," Obama said of Giffords and Kelly.The president said he also prayed that "a better day will dawn" over Egypt, where violence has erupted between supporters and opponents of President Hosni Mubarak."We pray that violence in Egypt will end, and the rights and aspirations of the Egyptian people will be realized," Obama said."We are reminded that ultimately what matters is not what other people say about us, but whether we're being true to our conscience and true to our God," Obama said.Some conservatives and political opponents have questioned Obama's Christian faith. In fact, a Pew Research Center poll in August found that 18 percent of people wrongly believe Obama is Muslim — up from 11 percent who said so in March 2009. Just 34 percent said they thought Obama is Christian.First lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and several lawmakers also attended the annual breakfast, which every president since Dwight Eisenhower has participated in.Obama said he had prayed for God's intervention on any number or occasions, not always on the weightiest issues of the day.At one point, the president said he has prayed, "Lord, give me patience as I watch Malia go to her first dance, where there will be boys. Lord, let her skirt get longer as she travels to that place." Twelve-year-old Malia is the older of his two daughters. Sasha is 9.
