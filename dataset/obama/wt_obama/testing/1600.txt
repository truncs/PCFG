A film about President Obama’s childhood days in Indonesia made its debut in Jakarta on Wednesday, promising a very different perspective on the man in the White House.“Obama Anak Menteng” or “Obama the Menteng Kid,” is set in the upscale Jakarta neighborhood of Menteng, where Mr. Obama lived from 1967 to 1971 with his American mother and Indonesian stepfather.Co-director Damien Dematra said it showed the president in a light that Americans might find strange.“Viewers, especially Westerners, will see a different world. They’ll see Obama eating chicken satay, not hamburgers. They’ll see his neighbors and friends wearing checkered sarongs and Muslim caps,” he told Agence France-Presse.Even so, producers skirted controversy surrounding the extent that Islam influenced Mr. Obama’s early years in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country. A scene showing Mr. Obama, who is a Christian, praying like a Muslim was dropped as it was deemed “too political,” Mr. Dematra said.“He was just imitating other kids when they were praying, but it didn’t mean he wanted to be Muslim. That scene wasn’t even shot because I didn’t want people to take it out of context and use it against him,” he said.Mr. Obama has said his Indonesian stepfather was a nonpracticing Muslim, and his autobiography “Dreams from My Father” describes going to a “Muslim school.” News reports have since documented that the young Mr. Obama was listed as “Muslim” in Jakarta school records, though Indonesian law required one of five state-sanctioned religious listings.For his entire life as a public figure, Mr. Obama has described himself as a Christian who had a spiritual awakening as a young adult. But conspiracy theories surrounding his religious background continue to swirl.Based on his interviews with Mr. Obama’s surviving neighbors and friends in the Indonesian capital, Mr. Dematra claims the film is “60 percent fact and 40 percent fiction.”Midwife Fitriah Sari, who was in the audience at the film’s debut, said Mr. Obama was portrayed favorably.“He showed that sometimes saying sorry is actually more effective than using the fist in solving conflict,” Ms. Sari said.Another who saw the film, Asmul Khairi, said: “Obama is shown to be able to get along with anyone, regardless of race, religion or skin color. He showed cultural or physical differences are no barrier to forging meaningful friendships.”The film features a cast of little-known Indonesian actors and was filmed in just over a month in the West Java city of Bandung. Twelve-year-old American Hasan Faruq Ali plays the future president, who was known as “Barry” to his schoolmates.Like Mr. Obama, Hasan — who had no prior acting experience — is the son of a mixed-race couple and moved from the United States to Indonesia as a toddler.
