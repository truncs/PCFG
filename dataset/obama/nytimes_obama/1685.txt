NEW YORK — President Obama is beginning his first opening of the United Nations General Assembly — that multi-day gridlock event that ties up traffic in midtown Manhattan as everyone from Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi to Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez show up to pontificate and negotiate. White House officials are hoping to showcase Mr. Obama taking command on this stage; they have a full week planned. Today, he gets things going early with an address to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon’s climate change conference, at 9:15. During that speech, Mr. Obama will try to delineate the differences between himself and his predecessor, former President George Bush, and will strike an urgent tone urging quick action, particularly from not only the United States, but fast-growing economic powerhouses India and China as well. Next, Mr. Obama will hold meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas—first one-on-one with each man, and then a “trilateral” meeting with both of them. There’s been virtually no progress on Middle East peace talks since Mr. Obama took office—and he still hasn’t gotten the Israelis to agree to a settlement freeze; his envoy, George Mitchell, recently returned from a trip to the region with nothing. Then it’s lunch with African heads of state, followed by a summit meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Early this evening, Mr. Obama will attend former President Clinton’s Global Initiative sessions, where he will address the dignitaries assembled about economic development for poor countries. Then it’s back to the United Nations to attend Mr. Ban’s Climate Change dinner. Whew.
