 As Mr. Obama speaks, the words, “He failed,” flash across the screen, before the ad switches to Mr. Romney, who says: “I’m going to do something to government. I call it the smaller, simpler, smarter approach to government. Getting rid of programs, turning programs back to states and, finally, making government itself more efficient. I’m going to get rid of ObamaCare. It’s killing jobs. And it’s keeping our kids from having the bright prospects they deserve. We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in. I’ll make sure that America is a job-creating machine like it has been in the past. It’s high time to bring those principles of fiscal responsibility to Washington, D.C. I’m Mitt Romney and I approve this message.”In an e-mail release, the Romney campaign defended its use of the truncated quote, explaining that, “the tables have turned,” and the line Mr. Obama once used against Mr. McCain could now be leveled against Mr. Obama.One other problem with the 60-second spot is the implication that Mr. Obama is trying to avoid talking about the economy. Out of necessity, Mr. Obama frequently addresses the economy; the ad was pegged to first be broadcast on the day Mr. Obama heads to New Hampshire — where, in fact, he will be talking about the economy.
