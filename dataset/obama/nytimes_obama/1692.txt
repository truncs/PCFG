It’s official. President Obama has accepted Representative Joe Wilson’s apology.“Yes I do,’’ Mr. Obama said, in response to a question from reporters during a meeting with his Cabinet Thursday morning. “I’m a big believer that we all make mistakes. He apologized quickly and without equivocation and I’m appreciative of that.’’Mr. Wilson, as many Americans know by now, is the South Carolina Republican who erupted during the president’s televised address to a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening, shouting “You lie!.’’ after Mr. Obama dismissed as false the assertion that his health care plan would cover illegal immigrants.The congressman later issued a statement of regret, and called the White House to convey his apologies to Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, who accepted on Mr. Obama’s behalf. But Mr. Obama’s remarks Thursday were the first words directly from the president on it.The outburst was a political gift to the White House, underscoring Mr. Obama’s point that the health care debate has been plagued by incivility. Mr. Obama could not seem to resist returning to that point on Thursday, just as soon as he gave Mr. Wilson a pass.“I do think that, as I said last night, we have to get to a point where we can have a conversation about big important issues that matter to the American people without vitriol, without name calling,’’ the president said. Americans, he said, “are turned off when they see people using wild accusations, false claims, name calling, sharply ideological approaches to solving problems. They want pragmatism.’’As for Mr. Wilson, he said in an interview on CNN that he was told by the Republican leadership to apologize, and that he was ‘’very grateful’’ the president had accepted.
