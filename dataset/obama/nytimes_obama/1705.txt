OTTUMWA, Iowa — President Obama, returning to the scene of one of his greatest political triumphs, appealed today to the Iowa voters who helped send him to the White House to keep Democrats in Congress come November.“I wouldn’t be president if it wasn’t for Iowa,” Mr. Obama said at the Siemens Wind Turbine Blade Manufacturing Plant in Fort Madison, referring to his primary victory in 2008. It was the first stop on a two-day tour of three Midwest states that Mr. Obama is making to try to convince voters that his economic policies are working despite the high unemployment rate.Mr. Obama credited the plant for its work with wind power, which he said could eventually provide power to 20 percent of the country. Afterward, he headed to Ottumwa for a town-hall-style meeting as part of what the White House is billing as a Main Street tour.  The White House is keenly aware that for the last 50 years, the party has lost seats in the midterm election whenever its president’s average approval rating that September and October dropped below 50 percent. In recent weeks, Mr. Obama’s national job approval rating has hovered near, or just below, 50 percent.Part of Mr. Obama’s campaign-style swing through the Midwest is meant to shore up those numbers. The president, his advisers say, is paying close attention to the midterm elections and is receiving frequent briefings, complete with the latest poll results.In Fort Madison, Mr. Obama also called for passage of an energy bill in Congress.
