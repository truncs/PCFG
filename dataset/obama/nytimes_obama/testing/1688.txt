President Obama walked down from Air Force One after his plane landed shortly before 11 a.m. Monday. He and Gov. David A. Paterson exchanged a brief greeting. They shook hands. Mr. Obama gave Mr. Paterson a half-embrace, then whispered into his ear for a few seconds. It was impossible for anyone nearby to hear over the roar of the engines.  ?

PATERSON No one knows what he said, right?. It was a big deal at the time. But I think I know what he said.MR. OBAMA What?.MR. PATERSON I think he said, “Scarlett, if you ever change your name to David Paterson, make sure you run for governor.” MR. OBAMA Why are we still hugging?.MR. PATERSON It’s nice to hug sometimes.

I forget the name.MR. PATERSON Me, too. That’s so weird. Do you remember your dreams?.MR. OBAMA Sometimes.MR. PATERSON Me, too!. We have so much in common. Mr. OBAMA Ahhh. MR.

OBAMA It’s not going to happen because you’re not going to run.MR. PATERSON I’m going to start screaming.MR. OBAMA O.K., hypothetically.MR. PATERSON Hypothetically, what if I came to work for you?.MR. OBAMA As what?.MR. PATERSON Governor?.MR. OBAMA I don’t really have a position like that open.MR. PATERSON Do you feel that I might be a kind of freelancer, simply sitting in on meetings, perhaps speaking to the press, traveling on your plane?.MR. OBAMA No. David, at some point you have to stop holding me. MR. PATERSON We’re similar in so many ways, don’t you think?.MR. OBAMA Not so much.MR.
