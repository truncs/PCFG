 Hoping to spare his party an embarrassing defeat in one of the year’s most closely watched elections, President Obama on Wednesday campaigned alongside Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, saying that a Democratic victory in the state would help the president carry out the political change he was elected to bring to Washington last year. Mr. Corzine is the first incumbent governor to seek re-election since the economic crisis hit last fall, and he is locked n a tight race with the Republican nominee, Christopher J. Christie, who has criticized Mr. Corzine over New Jersey’s spiraling taxes and rising unemployment. But Mr. Obama told a crowd of more than 3,000 at Fairleigh Dickinson University that it was unfair to blame Mr. Corzine for a global recession that has battered every state in the nation. And he praised Mr. Corzine, saying he had helped to mitigate the pain the downturn has inflicted on middle-class families by preserving financing for education and health care and making New Jersey one of the first states to create its own economic stimulus plan. “For the last four years, you’ve had a leader who’s put the interests of hardworking New Jersey families ahead of the special interests,” he said, calling Mr. Corzine one of the “best partners I have in the White House.”Mr. Obama also accused Republicans of “selective memory” by ignoring the fact that the economy collapsed during the final month of President George W. Bush’s term, and warned that Mr. Christie would reimpose the same “trickle-down” economic policies that led to the downturn.“They made the mess and now they’re complaining about how fast we’re cleaning it up,” Mr. Obama said, bringing a roar of laughter and applause from the crowd.Mr. Corzine was clearly buoyed by the support from Mr. Obama, who won New Jersey handily last fall and remains highly popular in the state. Speaking before the president, Mr. Corzine promised to be brief “because I know who you’re here to see,” and he used the joint appearance to align himself tightly with Mr. Obama’s policies. Mr. Corzine said that like Mr. Obama, he had fought for expanded health care programs and increased financing for early education and alternative energy“I’m proud to be President Obama’s partner in building a better America and certainly a better New Jersey,” Mr. Corzine said. The appearance was part of a political blitz for Mr. Obama, who appeared in New York Tuesday to raise more than $3 million for two Democrats and is scheduled to stump in Massachusetts and Virginia next week. Mr. Christie was careful not to criticize Mr. Obama, but said that New Jersey voters were savvy enough to judge Mr. Corzine on his own record.
