President Barack Obama arrived here on Thursday morning to formally accept the Nobel Peace Prize and to attend a daylong series of events to commemorate the award that was created 108 years ago by Alfred Nobel. Mr. Obama stepped off Air Force One into the crisp morning air of this Norwegian city after flying overnight from Washington with his wife, Michelle, and a small group of friends and relatives who are accompanying him on a brief trip to Norway.  “The goal is not to win a popularity contest or to get an award – even one as esteemed as the Nobel Peace Prize,” Mr. Obama said, when asked by a reporter here whether he believed his honor was premature. “The goal is to advance American interests, make ourselves a continuing force for good in the world – something that we have been for decades now.” He added, “And If I’m successful in those tasks, then hopefully some of the criticism will subside, but that’s not really my concern. And if I’m not successful, then all the praise and the awards in the world won’t disguise that fact.”  The president stopped by the Nobel Institute, where he signed his name in the guest book alongside previous winners, who include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa and scores of others. He said that the prize for Dr. King in 1964 had “a galvanizing effect around the world, but also lifted his stature in the United States in a way that allowed him to be more effective.” “In addition to being honored to receive it,” Mr. Obama told reporters, “I think it’s important to congratulate the Nobel Committee for the work that it’s done over the course of history to highlight the cause of peace, but also to give voice to the voiceless and the oppressed around the world.”  A dark haze hung over the city, but people lined the roads to catch a glimpse of Mr. Obama and his entourage. Across the street from the institute, a crowd chanted and held up a yellow banner, saying: “Obama You Won It, Now Earn It.”  Mr. Obama, who is scheduled to stay in Oslo for about 26 hours, has miffed some Norwegians by cutting short his participation in traditional events surrounding the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, including a luncheon and a concert on Friday evening. It prompted the largest-circulation newspaper in Norway, Verdens Gang, to conduct a survey asking whether people thought it was impolite of Mr. Obama to decline an invitation to a Nobel luncheon with the King. The poll of 1,000 Norwegians found that 44 percent said it was impolite, while 34 percent said they did not mind.
