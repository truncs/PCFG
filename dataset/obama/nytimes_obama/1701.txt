President Obama has called off his trip to Australia and Indonesia, deeming it necessary to stay in Washington to push for passage of the health care legislation up for a vote later this weekend in the House.In making the announcement, Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Obama on Thursday was telephoning the leaders of the two countries to say he will be staying in Washington to nurse passage of what could be the signature issue of his presidency.“The president greatly regrets the delay,” Mr. Gibbs said. “Passage of health insurance reform is of paramount importance and the president is determined to see this battle through.”Mr. Gibbs noted that the House, which received preliminary costs estimates for the health care bill from the Congressional Budget Office this morning, is now expected to vote Sunday afternoon. The Senate is expected to take up final action as early as next week.Pressure has been building for the House Democratic leadership to muster the 216 votes needed to pass the bill. Hinting at the behind-the-scenes persuasion talks to corral votes, Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee said of Mr. Obama’s decision: “You have to talk to some people. You have to twist some arms. His personal presence helps.”And Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, said of the president’s decision during her briefing: “This is historical. I am sure he wants to be here for the history.”Mr. Obama had already delayed the trip by several days, after House Democrats complained privately to the White House that they were being forced to take a quick vote on health care so Mr. Obama and his family could leave on the overseas trip. Last week, the White House announced that Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia would no longer be joining Mr. Obama on what they said would be an abbreviated trip.Mr. Obama initially pushed his departure date back to Sunday. Now, Mr. Gibbs said, that departure date is being pushed back to sometime in June.
