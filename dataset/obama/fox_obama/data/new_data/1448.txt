President Obama's failure to stand his ground in ongoing negotiations with Republicans on key issues from taxes to jobless benefits has stirred howls of protest from many of his supporters on the left who are beginning to question the president's leadership skills.Supporters say Obama should have been able to close the deal by now on extending the Bush tax cuts for only middle- and lower-income households and renewing another round of unemployment insurance.Instead, Obama continues to extend his hand to Republican leaders who have made clear that any compromises with the White House on spending and tax cuts would have to be on their terms.One liberal group, the Progressive Change Committee, is circulating a petition telling Obama that "Americans want him to fight the Bush tax cuts for millionaires – and that Democrats will keep losing if he keeps caving."Yet there are some veteran Democratic analysts who say it's not time to hit the panic button yet."Forgive me if I sound a bit jaded. I've heard it before," said Bill Galston, a former top aide to President Bill Clinton who served in the administration when Republicans captured Congress two years after Clinton took office. Galston told FoxNews.com that there was a six-month period when "Clinton couldn't do anything right" and he was seen as increasingly "irrelevant.""And somehow he was re-elected handsomely in '96," he said.But Obama continues to suffer setbacks one month after Republicans crushed Democrats in the midterm elections, capturing control of the House in a landslide and increasing their ranks in the Senate.On Saturday, Senate Republicans rejected two proposals extending the Bush tax cuts for all but the wealthiest households, prompting Obama to say he was "very disappointed" but determined to find a solution in further negotiations. Obama has said he is willing to back a temporary extension of tax cuts for households earning over $250,000 per year.Obama further enraged his supporters when he announced this week he wanted Congress to freeze the pay of civilian federal government employees as a step toward cutting the huge U.S. budget deficit. The unions have vowed to fight the proposal and Democrats have called it short-sighted.Liberal economist Paul Krugman wrote in his New York Times column this week that Democrats will have to look elsewhere for leadership."It's hard to escape the impression that Republicans have taken Mr. Obama's measure – that they're calling his bluff in the belief that he can be counted on to fold," he wrote. "And it's also hard to escape the impression that they're right."But Galston said Obama's leadership may not be a problem at all."I guess the question is whether we're talking about issues of style or issues of fundamental objectives," he said.
