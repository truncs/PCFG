President Barack Obama opened a six-day European tour Monday in Ireland, where he planned to celebrate his own Irish roots and give a boost to a nation grappling with the fallout from its financial collapse.After an overnight flight from Washington, Air Force One touched down Monday morning in a rainy and very windy Dublin. It was Ireland's worst storm in months and threatened to derail portions of the president's itinerary, which was to begin with a meeting with Ireland's political leaders.The centerpiece of the president's largely ceremonial one-day visit with his wife, Michelle, is a jaunt to Moneygall, the tiny village in County Offaly that is the ancestral homeland of Obama's great-great-great grandfather on his Kansas-born mother's side.As the story goes, Falmouth Kearney, a shoemaker, left Moneygall for the United States in 1850 at the height of Ireland's Great Famine. Obama's roots in the town were discovered during the 2008 presidential campaign.Residents in the village of about 350 have been eagerly anticipating Obama's arrival, applying fresh coats of paint to their homes, patching up the roads and hurriedly building a coffee shop called -- what else?. -- Obama CafDe.White House aides say the president shares their excitement and may even raise a pint at a local pub and connect with a few distant relatives."It's certainly quite likely that in a town of that size that is so deeply rooted in that part of Ireland that there are people who share those ties," said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications.Obama was to wrap up his trip here with an open-air speech -- weather permitting -- at College Green, the same spot in the center of Dublin where President Bill Clinton drew a massive crowd for a speech during his 1995 trip to Ireland.Obama's remarks will be part of a larger rally that includes musical performances and appearances by popular Irish actors and athletes. In keeping with the festive mood, Obama aides said the president's speech would not be political, instead focusing on the deep ties that bind the U.S. and Ireland."It's also a chance to talk about the enormous affinity, frankly, that the American people have for Ireland that's rooted in part in the huge population of Irish-Americans here," Rhodes told reporters before the president left Washington.Obama arrived just days after Britain's Queen Elizabeth II visited the Emerald Isle, the first trip to Ireland by a British monarch in about 100 years.The back-to-back visits have given the Irish a much-needed reason to celebrate as they struggle to climb out of the financial hole created by the collapse of the country's banks and housing market.Gripped by debt, Ireland was forced to take a bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund in November that could total $100 billion.
