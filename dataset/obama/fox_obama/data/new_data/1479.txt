Defiantly protecting his record, President Obama on Tuesday challenged Republicans to explain why they oppose the spending boosts and tax credits that he says have helped communities rebound. Said Obama: "Tell us why doing nothing would be better for America."In the latest campaign stop for his economic efforts, this one in struggling Ohio, Obama took concerted swipes at what he called the "unified, determined opposition of one party." He said it is not too late for bipartisanship and appealed for it -- but not until after criticizing those he said were badmouthing his steps."If the just-say-no crowd had won out -- if we had done things the way they wanted to go -- we'd be in a deeper world of hurt," Obama said in the swing state of Ohio, where the unemployment rate is close to 11 percent, above the already-high nationwide average of near 10 percent.The president came to explain and defend the economic stimulus spending, tax credits, extended unemployment benefits and other help that he championed with support from mostly the Democrats in Congress. Without it, he said, "the steady progress we are beginning to see across America just wouldn't exist."Republicans have opposed the steep cost of Obama's plans and criticized the pace of the promised recovery, particularly on the key measure of jobs.His comments came on a day of closely watched primary elections in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Arkansas. Two Democratic senators -- Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas -- face stiff challenges from fellow Democrats who say the senators were not sufficiently loyal to party priorities.The president, meanwhile, is on a drive to show people that the country's economy is getting better even as their individual situations may not be yet. He got out of Washington and donned a hardhat, goggles and a fire-retardant jacket while touring a hot, noisy plant where metal piping was being manufactured.And he acknowledged that some may not be impressed by a president swooping into town when all they want is to see the headline saying: "You're hired."Still, he tried to keep spirits up to employees at V&amp;M STAR, a place he said is benefiting directly from his economic policies.The parent company of the V&amp;M is spending $650 million to build a 1 million-square-foot mill in Youngstown now that the nearby Norfolk Southern railroad is building a spur, thanks to money from last year's stimulus act. To applause from the assembled workers, Obama said it would be the biggest industrial plant built in the region since a GM plant went up in nearby Lordstown in the 1960s.Overall, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first three months of this year.
