President Barack Obama sent a tough message to Republicans on Thursday, ahead of an expected Senate battle over his $447 billion jobs bill."As we look towards next week, any senator out there who's thinking about voting against this jobs bill when it comes up for a vote needs to explain exactly why they would oppose something that we know would improve our economic situation at such an urgent time for our families and for our businesses," Obama said at a news conference.The president said the "problems Europe is having today could have a very real effect on our economy at a time when it's already fragile. But this jobs bill can help guard against another downturn if the situation in Europe gets any worse. It'll boost economic growth, it'll put people back to work.""This jobs bill is fully paid for by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share," Obama said. "Some see this as class warfare. I see it as a simple choice: We can either keep taxes exactly as they are for millionaires and billionaires, with loopholes that lead them to have lower tax rates, in some cases, than plumbers and teachers, or we can put teachers and construction workers and veterans back on the job."The bill introduced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Wednesday night includes a so-called "millionaire's surtax," a separate 5.6% tax on income over $1 million.A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the surtax would raise more than enough to pay for the jobs bill within the required 10-year window.The tax hike would kick in in 2013, rather than 2012 as previously proposed."It satisfied our caucus' desire for this surtax on millionaires to pay for  and is consistent with the president saying no tax increases in 2012," a Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN.Asked about the surtax, Obama said, "The approach that the Senate is taking I'm comfortable with, in order to deal with the jobs bill. We're still going to need to reform this tax code to make sure that we're closing loopholes, closing special-interest tax breaks, making sure that the very simple principle, what we call the Buffett rule, which is that millionaires and billionaires aren't paying lower tax rates than ordinary families -- that that's in place."So there's going to be more work to do with respect to making our tax system fair and just and promoting growth, but in terms of the immediate action of getting this jobs bill passed, I'm fine with the approach that they're taking."Republicans struck back."We will not stand for a permanent tax hike for a temporary stimulus that is largely a rehash of the same failed stimulus ideas," the press office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell quoted the Kentucky Republican as saying.
