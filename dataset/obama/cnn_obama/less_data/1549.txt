President Obama, Gov. Charlie Crist, and Adm. Thad Allen at a briefing with local officials in Pensacola, Florida Tuesday. A new poll indicates nearly half of the public disapproves of how Obama's handling the oil spill.Washington  – Nearly half of all Americans disapprove of the way President Barack Obama is handling the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a new national poll released hours before the president gives a prime-time address from the Oval Office on the crisis.An AP-GfK survey released Tuesday indicates that 48-percent of the public disapproves of how Obama's handling the oil spill, up 15 percentage points from a month ago. Thirty-nine percent approve of how the president's dealing with the crisis, down three points from May. According to the survey, 13- percent say they neither approve nor disapprove.Other recent polls also indicate that a minority of Americans approve of the way Obama and his administration are handling the massive spill.The president's overall job approval stands at 50-percent in the new AP-GfK survey, up one point from a month ago."Other recent polls have also shown that the oil spill has not affected the overall opinion of Obama's performance in office," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "Many Americans may think his track record on the economy, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and other issues are more important than the situation in the Gulf. It's also possible that the oil spill has affected views of Obama personally but not his performance as president."The president's prime-time address will come as he returns from a two-day tour of the region, Obama's fourth trip to the Gulf Coast since the environmental disaster began on April 20.The AP-GfK poll was conducted June 9-14, with 1,002 adults questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.
