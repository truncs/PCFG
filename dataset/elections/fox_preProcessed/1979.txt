Labor unions are celebrating one of their biggest victories in decades after turning back an Ohio law that curbed collective bargaining rights for the state 's public workers .
The vote showed unions are still a potent political force that ca n't be ignored .
The question for many is whether to interpret Tuesday 's Ohio referendum as simply a rejection of Republican overreach in a heavily unionized state or more broadly as a barometer of a battleground state that could resonate with voters nationwide .
Union leaders say they hope it brings about a resurgence for a labor movement long in decline and sends a strong message to other states where lawmakers are thinking about restricting union rights .
But they also want to use the outcome as a spark to help re-elect President Barack Obama and put more Democrats in office next year .
`` I think the outcome is an absolute momentum-shifting victory for the labor movement , '' said Harold Schaitberger , president of the International Association of Firefighters .
If unions succeed next year in recalling Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker , a top target after he pushed through similar legislation limiting union rights in his state , Schaitberger predicted `` tremendous impact across the country . ''
`` Now you 're talking about having significant impact in the 2012 election cycle for many politicians and putting two battleground states in strong play for our candidates , '' he said .
By a nearly 2-1 margin , Ohio voters repealed a new law that would have severely limited the bargaining rights of more than 350,000 teachers , firefighters , police officers and other state employees .
The law signed in late March by Republican Gov. John Kasich would have banned public employee strikes , scrapped binding arbitration , and denied public workers the ability to negotiate pensions and health care benefits .
Kasich had said the law would help hold down taxes and make the state more appealing to business .
We Are Ohio , the largely union-funded opponent coalition , painted the issue as a threat to public safety and middle-class workers , spending millions of dollars on TV ads filled with images of firefighters , police officers , teachers and nurses .
`` It 's a huge victory .
It ca n't be underestimated , '' said Doug Schoen , a Democratic strategist who worked for President Bill Clinton .
`` But unions will try to read it broadly , and I do n't think it is . ''
Schoen said unions would characterize the win as `` a resurgence of the union movement , the resurgence of the left and the revitalization of the Democratic Party .
I think it 's a repudiation of efforts to get rid of collective bargaining -- no more , no less . ''
