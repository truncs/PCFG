Bobby JindalAge : 39Current Position : Governor of Louisiana Previous experience : Congressman from Louisiana 's 1st District ; assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service ; president of the Louisiana university system ; executive director of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare ; secretary of Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals Education : Undergraduate degree from Brown University ; Master of Letters from Oxford University Family : Wife , Supriya , two sons , one daughterWhat you might not know : Jindal 's given name is Piyush , but as a boy insisted on being called Bobby , a homage to his favorite television character , Bobby Brady .
His Pitch : Something Completely DifferentThe idea that a 39-year-old , Indian-American , Catholic policy wonk would even be in the running for the Republican nomination for president is remarkable in itself .
Republicans have a presidential archetype : Old , white , Protestants who are policy generalists .
But perhaps it is all things that make Jindal different that make him so appealing to a substantial number of GOPers .
For a party looking for a rebranding , he would certainly shake up public perceptions .
In the decade between his first public-sector job and his election to Louisiana Governor , Jindal was marked in his state and nationally as one to watch .
But his rapid ascent through state government and politics surprised his supporters and disappointed his detractors who were waiting for him to stumble .
Jindal has the conservative bona fide to excite the party 's base and a track record to impress skeptics .
He has been an effective reformer at the state and national levels and has built a strong track record on spending and ethics reform in Baton Rouge .
And , he became a favorite of many Republicans when he went toe to toe with President Obama during the Gulf oil spill debacle .
The Knocks : Not Ready for PrimetimeOh that terrible speech ! .
Seldom has a big speech backfired on a politician the way Jindal 's 2009 Republican rebuttal to President Obama 's first address to a joint session of Congress did .
Jindal looked lonesome and sounded reedy in the cavernous , darkened front hall of the governor 's mansion after the frothy cheers and bright lights that bathed Obama .
He undid all of the hype that had been building around him since his election and short list status for John McCain 's running mate .
