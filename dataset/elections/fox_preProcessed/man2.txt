At Tuesday 's sentencing hearing for Rod Blagojevich , more than 100 people and media waited in line for a seat inside the courtroom and a chance to hear the former Illinois governor speak .
But Blagojevich was n't the only person in court attracting attention from the media .
Sister Susanne Kullowitch , a nun with the Sisters of Catholic Charity in Chicago , showed up to see Blagojevich and listen to a portion of the hearing .
Kullowitch says she 's been praying for Blagojevich since his retrial began earlier this year and even sat through several days of his retrial where she met Blagojevich 's wife , Patti .
Kullowitch said she 's `` grateful for what Blagojevich did for seniors '' while he was Illinois governor , providing free rides on mass transit .
She also said she believes the punishment Blagojevich faces for his conviction is `` too harsh and severe . ''
Prosecutors want Blagojevich to serve 15 to 20 years .
Kullowitch said Blagojevich has suffered enough through public humiliation and feels he should get probation instead of serving time behind bars .
When Kullowitch saw Rod Blagojevich in court today , she says he told her to continue praying for him .
The hair jokes , the phone taps , the slick suits , the shouting attorneys and babbling defendant -- all of it is coming to an end soon as the circus fsurrounding convicted former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich packs up its tent .
Blagojevich and his team will be back in the Dirksen Federal Building on Tuesday for a pre-sentencing hearing .
Judge James Zagel has indicated that he will consider arguments on Tuesday , and then on Wednesday , deliver the sentence that threatens to keep Blago off reality TV for at least 10 years .
The 10-year figure is a reasonable calculation because Blagojevich 's former fundraiser , Tony Rezko , was recently slapped with a 10-and-half-year prison term .
`` Certainly Blagojevich has a broader scheme , had more responsibility than Rezko .
So , logically it is hard to see how Blagojevich should not get a larger sentence , '' said former federal prosecutor Jeffery Cramer .
A number of factors can influence Zagel 's decision .
The fact that Blagojevich never uttered a word of contrition , in the volumes of everything he said , can work against him .
The fact that Blagojevich was not intimidated by the six-and-a-half-year sentence his predecessor , former Gov. George Ryan , is currently serving works against him .
Of course , working in his favor are executive accomplishments that helped the residents of his state .
Law Professor Len Cavise from DePaul University in Chicago said Blagojevich can also buy some leniency by arguing that he 's a bumbling fool with a big mouth .
