President Barack Obama 's withdrawal plan for Afghanistan marks the beginning of the end of a troop-intensive approach to countering a Taliban insurgency that until recent months had fought the U.S. and its NATO allies to a standstill .
As the war grinds on , the Obama administration will shift the U.S. military 's focus more toward targeting terrorist leaders , while giving Afghans more of the lead in fighting and eventually reconciling with the Taliban .
What remains in doubt is the endgame : finding a political solution to the conflict .
Are the Taliban under enough military pressure to compel them to enter serious peace talks with Kabul ? .
Robert Gates , the soon-to-retire defense secretary , thinks not at least not before the end of this year .
But recognizing that Afghans and Americans alike are weary of war , Gates concedes that the current troop-intensive U.S. approach is not sustainable .
So the U.S. troop withdrawal will accelerate next year , with all 30,000 of the `` surge '' troops that Obama ordered to Afghanistan expected to be gone by September 2012 , leaving about 68,000 U.S. troops and a few tens of thousands from other coalition countries .
As the force shrinks , so will the scope and ambition of the U.S.-led military campaign .
In his speech to the nation , Obama made no mention of defeating the Taliban .
Instead he focused on al-Qaida , which is not primarily in Afghanistan .
`` What we can do , and will do , is build a partnership with the Afghan people that endures one that ensures that we will be able to continue targeting terrorists and supporting a sovereign Afghan government , '' he said , adding that the goal is not to make Afghanistan `` a perfect place . ''
`` We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely , '' he said .
The shift is a setback for the war 's current commander , Gen. David Petraeus , the author of the military 's guidebook for counterinsurgency .
A year ago , Petraeus and the likeminded commander he replaced , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , were talking about a `` fully resourced , comprehensive counterinsurgency campaign '' in Afghanistan as the key to turning around a stalemated war .
Petraeus is now slated to retire from the Army and become CIA director , and the next Afghanistan commander , Gen. John Allen , will be trimming the U.S. sails .
In his speech , Obama said the U.S. intends to remain committed to Afghanistan 's future not least because it is in U.S. interests to prevent the country from reverting to a haven for al-Qaida .
