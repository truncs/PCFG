Republican presidential contender Michele Bachmann lost her campaign chief Monday , along with his close deputy , in a campaign shake-up that the Minnesota congresswoman 's aides sought to downplay .
Citing health reasons , veteran GOP strategist Ed Rollins stepped down as campaign manager .
Bachmann said one of her strategists would take over on an interim basis as Rollins moves to a senior adviser role .
`` In less than 50 days and with fewer resources than other campaigns , Ed was the architect that led our campaign to a historic victory in Iowa , '' Bachmann said in a statement released late Monday , pointing to her win in the Ames Straw Poll last month .
`` I am grateful for his guidance and leadership , and fortunate to retain his valuable advice even though his health no longer permits him to oversee the day-to-day operations of the campaign .
`` Speaking to CNN , where he was a contributor before the Bachmann campaign , the 68-year-old Rollins said the front-runners were now former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry .
He said Perry 's late entry into the race slowed Bachmann 's buzz and fundraising .
`` I think legitimately it 's a Romney-Perry race , '' he said .
`` I think she 's the third candidate at this point in time -- which is way different and better than we 'd thought when we started this thing -- and she 's very much in this thing .
`` Rollins , who suffered a stroke a year and a half ago , said his plan had been to put together a team and get through the Iowa straw poll and then make a transition .
`` I have great affection for her .
I 'll do everything I can to help her .
It 's still very much the team I put in place .
I just do n't have the endurance to go 12 - , 14-hour days seven days a week anymore , '' he said .
Rollins ' departure as campaign chief was first reported by Politico .
His deputy , David Polyansky , who worked with him when they ran former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 's presidential bid in 2008 , also planned to step aside , Rollins told CNN .
`` David and I have been a team for a long time , '' he said .
`` It 's just a good time to make a change .
`` Bachmann , who won election to Congress in 2006 and was a leader of tea partyers on Capitol Hill , had been making great strides in her presidential bid .
