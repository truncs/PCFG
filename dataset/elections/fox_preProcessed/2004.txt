Democrats and Republicans in this feisty election season are more likely to reach across the aisle to take a political punch than to offer a hug or a handshake .
But even with partisan rhetoric spouting from stumps nationwide , Democrats in states that saw Tea Party candidates win the GOP nomination are touting endorsements from some high-profile state Republicans .
Reid 's campaign Thursday announced 200 GOPers had joined its `` Republicans for Harry Reid '' group .
Among them are big-time players in the state 's key industries , who have benefited from a Nevadan as Senate majority leader , as well as prominent figures in Silver State politics such as Sig Rogich , a former George H.W. Bush adviser , former chair of the Nevada Taxpayers ' Association Fred Gibson , and politically active former first lady Dema Guinn , widow of former Gov. Kenny Guin .
`` After losing to me in a primary , during which she ran a very negative campaign and distorted my record , referred to me as a liar and a RINO , I never heard one word from her , or a concession , or an offer of support .
Instead she lent aid and comfort in an effort to recall me as state senator , '' Nevada state Senate minority leader Bill Raggio said of Sharron Angle in a statement endorsing Reid .
`` Those are personal issues which I was willing to put behind me , '' he continued .
Raggio went on to indicate he was not thrilled to endorse Reid , but he could not overlook either Angle 's `` totally ineffective '' turn as assemblywoman or her `` unwillingness to work with others '' and `` extreme positions . ''
`` There 's a lot of bad blood there , '' says Dave Damore , associate professor of political science at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas .
`` She 's never been the sort of get-along , go-along politician .
The other thing is , for a lot of folks here , the question is , are we going to be better off losing the Senate majority leader ? .
The sense is , we may not like some of these things , but it 's going to do a lot more for Nevada than a Senate delegation of -LRB- Sen. John -RRB- Ensign and Angle .
`` And anti-establishment atmosphere , which helped boost Tea Party candidates to the top in primaries in Utah , Delaware , and Alaska , is unattractive to some Nevadans deeply rooted in state politics and industry .
`` They 're all Republicans , but sort of establishment types , '' Damore says of `` Republicans for Reid , '' which includes several high-profile businessmen in Nevada 's gaming industry .
`` In many ways , her campaign is as much against Harry Reid and the perception of the Obama liberal agenda as it is versus the sort of establishment Republican , who has more or less , in her view , strayed from the party 's principles .
