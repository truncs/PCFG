Former President Bill Clinton on Friday called the November election a clash of ideas and urged Democratic voters not to let their anger over the sluggish economy cloud their judgment .
Clinton spoke to about 1,000 supporters at a rally in Santa Ana to drum up support for Democratic Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez , who is facing her first serious challenge in 14 years against Republican state Assemblyman Van Tran .
The former president credited Democrats with helping to stem the economic downturn , noting Sanchez voted for the federal stimulus package that he said helped prevent a bad situation from getting worse .
`` You have a choice .
Do n't let this election be a referendum on people 's disappointment and anger .
Do n't let amnesia get in the way , '' he told the crowd after running through a list of votes taken by Tran .
Clinton was appearing later Friday with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown at the University of California , Los Angeles , where hundreds of students and other supporters awaited his arrival .
He heads to Northern California next for weekend rallies in San Jose and Napa .
Clinton is campaigning nationwide with Democrats , many of whom are vulnerable this year .
He was in Mississippi and Arkansas on Thursday and has also campaigned on behalf of incumbents facing tough challengers this year , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington .
While Sanchez 's district is predominantly Democratic , she could be hurt this year by a tide of anti-incumbent sentiment sweeping a nation frustrated by the economy .
The race in California 's 47th Congressional district came into the spotlight after Sanchez told a Spanish-language television interviewer the `` Vietnamese and Republicans '' were trying to unseat her -- prompting Tran to accuse her of going on a `` racial rampage .
`` The ethnic friction in the campaign is unique to the gritty district that is home to Disneyland , where 71 percent of residents are Latino and 9 percent are Vietnamese , many of whom arrived as refugees in the 1970s .
Clinton said the last time he spoke at a rally in Santa Ana was to help Sanchez win election in 1996 .
He said this year 's elections mark an important choice between two sets of competing ideas about where to take the country .
The Democrats , Clinton said , helped slow the economic downturn , while the Republicans blame government for the economy 's ills and want to cut taxes for the rich -- taxes he said he does n't mind paying .
Clinton , professing his love for football , ran off a list of measures Democrats have taken to help small businesses and encourage investment in clean energy .
