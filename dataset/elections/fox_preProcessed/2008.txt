As Ohio Democrats prep for a final blowout weekend filled with rallies , welcoming both President Obama and former President Clinton , Republican governors from across the country are hitting the Buckeye State today to campaign for challenger John Kasich , a former nine-term congressman who has consistently led the polls by a single digit margin .
Ohio incumbent Governor Democrat Ted Strickland is battling to hold his seat against Kasich , former chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the Budget .
The latest Real Clear Politics average of polls puts Kasich up 3.2 points over Strickland and a Fox News Poll released Tuesday shows Kasich up by 4 points , 47 percent to 43 percent .
Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour , New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty will join Kasich at a rally in historic Lebanon .
Ohio has long been considered a quintessential bellwether state and strategically valuable in presidential elections .
Ohio voters have an uncanny ability to pick presidents , accurately voting for the winners every year since 1964 .
Strategists say it 's part of the reason President Obama has spent so much time here .
Barbour and Pawlenty are also widely considered likely contenders to run for the White House in 2012 .
Political analysts say having a same-party governor in place can help give candidates an edge , especially in a close race .
Ohio State University professor Paul Beck has been tracking state and national politics for decades and believes governors can play a valuable role when presidential contenders arrive in town .
`` Having a governor in place still brings you an on-the-ground organization .
It brings you the kind of support you can get when you come to a state , turning out crowds , doing a variety of other things , '' says Beck .
In 2006 Strickland won the race for governor by a wide margin following 16 years of Republican rule .
Then Mr. Obama took the state in the 2008 presidential election , beating McCain 51 percent to 47 precent in a state that backed President Bush in both 2000 and 2004 .
Now , in 2010 , unemployment is high and sustained job losses are haunting the labor sector .
Since the stimulus was signed in February of 2009 , the state has shed more than 166,000 jobs .
Strickland is facing a tough battle but it 's clear the White House sees the race as critical and Ohio as strategically important .
President Obama has made eleven trips to the state since taking office and will headline his final major rally before election day in Cleveland on Sunday .
