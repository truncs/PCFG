Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia , the longest-serving senator in American history , died Monday at the age of 92 , a spokesman for the family said .
Byrd , a Democrat who served in the U.S. Senate since 1959 , had been plagued by health problems in recent years and was confined to a wheelchair .
He had skipped several votes in Congress in the past months .
Jesse Jacobs , a family spokesman , said Byrd died peacefully at about 3 a.m. at Inova Hospital in Fairfax , Va. He was the oldest member of the 111th Congress .
The passing of Sen. Byrd will not affect the balance of power in the Senate .
West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin , a Democrat , will appoint a replacement senator to serve out the remainder of Byrd 's term , which ends in 2012 .
Statements from his longtime colleagues poured out Monday morning , as fellow senators remembered Byrd as a steadfast presence in the chamber and a veritable tome of knowledge on how the Senate works .
`` The people of West Virginia have lost a dedicated public servant , and America has lost a great defender of its most precious traditions , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a written statement .
`` He was the foremost guardian of the Senate 's complex rules , procedures and customs , and as leader of both the majority and the minority caucuses in the Senate he knew better than most that legislation is the art of compromise .
By virtue of his endurance , Robert Byrd knew and worked with many of the greats of the United States Senate .
`` President Obama said in a statement that the country has `` lost a voice of principle and reason '' with Byrd 's death .
`` He had the courage to stand firm in his principles , but also the courage to change over time , '' Obama said , in a veiled reference to his controversial past .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , a former senator , called Byrd the `` heart and soul '' of the chamber .
`` It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd , '' she said .
A traditional black drape has been placed over Byrd 's desk , a sign of respect for the deceased in Congress .
The veteran senator held a number of leadership roles during his tenure in the Senate , including conference secretary , majority whip and majority leader -- twice .
Prior to his death , Byrd worked as the president pro tempore -- the second highest ranking official in the Senate and the highest ranking senator in the majority party , putting Byrd third in line to the presidency .
