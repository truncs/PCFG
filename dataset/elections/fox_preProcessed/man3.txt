In what he described as an effort to `` compete in all 50 states , '' former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich took his surging campaign to New York City , holding a private one-on-one meeting with Donald Trump and a fundraiser at the Union League Club 's New York headquarters .
Gingrich met with `` The Donald '' in his midtown Manhattan office Monday morning and , arriving in a black SUV , was immediately swarmed by dozens of members of the media jostling for a word with the newly minted frontrunner .
About 50 tourists were among the crowd , taking a break from their holiday shopping along Fifth Avenue for an unexpected surprise .
Following the nearly hour-long meeting , both men emerged from Trump 's 26th floor office to take questions from reporters .
Praising Trump for being an `` American icon , '' Gingrich talked about an idea he pitched to Trump : creating a mentoring program in one of New York City 's poorest school districts .
Trump called it `` a great idea '' and , never missing an opportunity to self-promote , said he would be happy to get on board creating ten `` apprenti , '' which is a word he made up to pluralize the word `` apprentice .
`` At an afternoon press conference at the Union League Club , Gingrich did more damage control on previous comments he made about child labor laws .
Calling his words `` distorted , '' he repeatedly sought to explain his comments about how children as young as nine-years-old from poor neighborhoods should be able to work as janitors .
The intention , he said , is `` to get them into the world of work , get them into the opportunity to earn money , to get them into the habit of showing up and realizing that effort is rewarded and America is all about the work ethic . ''
He also had words of warning for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , saying her threat to release information from an ethics committee inquiry would bring an `` early Christmas gift . ''
`` If she 's suggesting she 's going to use material that she developed while she was on the ethics committee , that is a fundamental violation of the rules of the House and I would hope members would immediately file charges against her as soon as she does it , '' he said .
Pelosi served on the House ethics committee that investigated Gingrich for tax cheating and campaign finance violations during the 90 's .
She told the website `` Talking Points Memo '' she would release information about Gingrich `` when the time was right . ''
She went on to say `` I know a lot about him .
