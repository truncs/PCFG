Might future presidential debates feature candidates that voters ca n't see , ca n't hear and who answer questions in 140 characters or less ? .
Also on Wednesday , an Internet-based Tea Party group TheTeaParty.net announced it will hold a presidential debate with Republican candidates wholly on Twitter .
That debate is scheduled for July 20 , and candidates will answer questions via Twitter 's requisite restriction that encourages short answers : in 140 characters or less .
That Twitter debate will feature Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann , businessman Herman Cain , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , Michigan Rep. Thad McCotter , former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.Org anizers say they 've invited and are waiting for a response from other GOP presidential candidates including former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman , Texas Rep. Ron Paul , and even Gov. Rick Perry of Texas , who has not launched a presidential bid but is considering one .
Might forcing candidates to address complicated issues in 140 characters or less dumb down the issues to simple messages and campaign slogans ? .
`` I think the exact opposite is true , '' TheTeaParty.net spokesman Dustin Stockton told CNN .
`` It forces them to really have to answer the question .
`` As Stockton explained , though candidates will be limited by a character count , they will be allowed to respond in multiple tweets , and will have two or three minutes to `` delve into '' a question .
`` Everybody will have the opportunity to respond at the same time , '' Stockton said .
`` You 'll be able to compare each candidate 's answers side by side .
And since it 's a silent medium , the transcripts really kind of rip out somebody 's oratory skills to evade a question .
`` Meanwhile , Stockton addressed a larger point : that such forums allow conservatives to catch up with liberal counterparts who have long held an edge in using the Internet to rally supporters toward electoral success .
`` I 've been pitching this to our people as one more way that we 'll be able to close the technology gap , '' Stockton said .
`` Because our counterparts on the other side are way ahead of us in both bold grassroots organizations and social networking .
The Tea Party movement is really a response to close that gap , to remain competitive in modern elections .
`` Liberal online activists realize that conservatives are right on their heels .
The recent Netroots Nation gathering of liberal bloggers in Minneapolis saw competition from conservative bloggers attending the RightOnline conference - just blocks away .
Justin Rubin is the Executive Director of liberal MoveOn.org .
His group has been extremely successful in many of its online electoral strategies .
And Rubin told CNN that conservatives have imitated some of his group 's tactics .
