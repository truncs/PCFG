Nevada is the next major stop along the road to the White House .
The debate , at the Venetian Resort along the Strip in Las Vegas , kicks off a four day conference of Republican leaders from 13 western states and three territories .
`` This year , Westerners will have an exciting opportunity to host the first Republican Presidential debate in the Western United States , providing us with a distinct and active voice in our 2012 Presidential Election , '' says Jon Porter , chairman of the Western Republican Leadership Conference .
Porter , a former three term congressman from Nevada , says the conference `` is designed to educate , mobilize , and empower Republicans from our region .
Additionally , the WRLC will serve to spotlight the specific issues facing the west and underscore the importance of our Nevada caucus in determining our next Republican Presidential nominee .
`` In 2008 , Nevada joined Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina , as one of the states to kick off the long road to the White House .
Democrats focused on the state , with CNN holding a presidential debate in Las Vegas in November 2007 , and the major candidates , such as then Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and former Sen. John Edwards all campaigned in the stateBut while the Democrat 's caucus was binding , the GOP contest was not , and became an afterthought .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney ended up winning the contest , thanks in part to backing by the many Mormons who live in Nevada who decided to support their fellow member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints .
Last year Republican state party leaders changed the rules to make the 2012 caucus results binding , meaning that delegates attending the Republican National Convention in Florida next summer must stick with the candidate choices determined by the caucus results .
`` Three years ago , the Republicans did n't do anything until too late , eventually piggybacking on the Democrats ' early caucus .
Last year , they copied what the Democrats did in making the caucus binding , which many realized , because of the early date , will force candidates to come here , '' says Jon Ralston , who 's considered by many to be the dean of Nevada political reporters .
Ralston says that this time around Romney , who 's making his second bid for the nomination , appears to be the favorite in Nevada , but that businessman , former Godfather 's Pizza CEO and radio talk show host Herman Cain and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas could be factors .
So could Texas Gov. Rick Perry , who was endorsed last month by Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval .
Nevada was smack in the middle of the political spotlight in 2010 midterm elections , thanks to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's difficult but ultimately successful re-election bid .
