OK .
We admit it .
We , along with the rest of the national political press corps , will be fixated Saturday on the results of the presidential straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference .
Jack Kemp won the straw poll in 1987 , the year before 1988 presidential election .
Vice President George H.W. Bush ended up winning the party 's presidential nomination .
In 1995 , Phil Gramm came out on top at CPAC .
But Sen. Bob Dole ended up taking the GOP nomination .
Gary Bauer was the winner in 1999 , but Texas Gov. George W. Bush won the nomination the next year .
Four years ago former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney captured the straw poll at CPAC , the first of his three victories at the conference .
Romney used his appearance at the 2008 conference to end his bid for the GOP nomination , which as we all remember was won by Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Not such a great track record .
`` Straw polls are more of an anecdotal measurement than an empirical one .
It 's not as representative a sample of the actual voters participating in the primaries and caucuses around the country , '' Kevin Madden tells CNN .
Madden is a Republican strategist who served as national press secretary for Romney 's 2008 presidential campaign .
But just because straw polls do n't always , or even often , get it right , there are still plenty of reasons to keep an eye on them .
`` Straw polls can be a scrimmage in the game of expectations .
They can help unknown candidacies gain traction with a surprisingly strong performance , or they can hurt top-tier candidacies with a weak performance , '' adds Madden .
`` They can also serve as a display or organizational muscle , given that some campaigns decide to use straw polls to fine-tune or showcase their on-the-ground organizational skills .
`` And Madden should know .
Romney 's 2007 victory at the CPAC did give his bid for the White House a boost .
`` It helped us generate some buzz at a time where , in national polls , Gov. Romney was still only at three or four percent .
That win showed we were organized and efficient and had an ability to drive a contrast with Sen. McCain who , while he enjoyed 100 percent name recognition , had struggled with building support among conservative grassroots activists and voters , '' says Madden .
The candidates on this year 's CPAC ballot , listed in alphabetical order , are : Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , former talk show host Herman Cain , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman , former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , Romney , former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and South Dakota Sen. John Thune of South Dakota .
