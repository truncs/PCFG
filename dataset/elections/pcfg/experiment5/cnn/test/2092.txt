During Tuesday 's town hall event in New Hampshire , President Barack Obama was asked to grade his administration 's transparency .
He declined to give himself a grade , but cited a new report that says his administration is `` the most transparent administration that we have seen in a very , very long time , perhaps in the modern era .
`` The report - titled `` A Report Card on the Obama Administration 's Executive Branch Lobbying , Ethics and Transparency Reforms in 2009 '' - was released on January 11 .
It characterizes the Obama administration 's reform efforts as `` the strongest and most comprehensive lobbying , ethics , and transparency rules and policies ever established by an administration to govern its own activities .
`` This report stands in stark contrast to recent criticism the president has received for falling short on a promise to televise all health care negotiations on C-SPAN .

Fact Check : Who are the groups behind President Obama 's transparency `` report card '' ? .
Four groups are behind the report .
They are Common Cause , Democracy 21 , League of Women Voters , and U.S. PIRG .
Common Cause is a self-described nonpartisan , non-profit advocacy organization that was founded `` as a vehicle for citizens to make their voices heard in the political process and to hold their elected leaders accountable to the public interest .
`` Its 2009 report `` Campaign Finance Reform : A New Era '' calls for greater campaign transparency and an end to the dominant role of large campaign donors in the election process .
On Sunday it announced a partnership with the left-leaning political action group MoveOn in fighting the recent Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission .
Former Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer founded Democracy 21 in 1997 and serves as its current president and CEO .
The group aims to `` eliminate the undue influence of big money in American politics '' through campaign finance reform and other political reform measures .
On Tuesday Wertheimer testified before the Senate Rules Committee and called on Congress to `` move swiftly to enact legislation to mitigate the enormous damage done '' by the Supreme Court 's Citizens United decision .
Celebrating its 90th anniversary this year , the League of Women Voters has a long reputation for being a nonpartisan political advocacy group with interests ranging from global climate control to getting representation in Congress for the District of Columbia .
The organization sponsored the presidential debates from 1976 to 1984 but pulled out in 1988 , citing `` self-serving '' efforts by the Dukakis and Bush camps , which they accused of `` manipulations '' during the debate process .
