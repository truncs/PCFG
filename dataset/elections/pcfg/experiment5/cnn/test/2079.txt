As President Obama heads west Thursday to help out two Democratic senators facing tough elections this year , a Republican senate candidate in Colorado scolds the president in a new campaign television commercial .
Obama travels to Denver , Colorado Thursday afternoon , where he 'll be the headliner at two different fundraisers for Sen. Michael Bennet , who 's running this November for a full term in office .
But before he gets to the general election , Bennet first needs to successfully fend off a Democratic primary challenge from former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff .
Bennet was plucked out of political obscurity last year , when Gov. Bill Ritter named him to replace Sen. Ken Salazar , who stepped down to serve as Interior Secretary in the Obama Administration .
Bennet leads Romanoff in the battle for campaign cash and Thursday 's visit by Obama may help Bennet widen his fundraising margin .
As the president arrives in Colorado , former Lt. Governor Jane Norton , who appears to be the front-runner in the battle for the GOP senate nomination , launched an TV ad that accuses the president of `` massive spending and debt '' and urges Obama to `` pledge to balance the budget or decline to seek re-election .
`` Colorado was a success story for the Democrats over the past decade , as they made major gains in federal and state elections , which culminated with Denver hosting the 2008 Democratic National Convention and Obama winning the state in the presidential election .
But politically it appears the times have changed .
`` What a difference a year makes , '' said Evan Tracey , president of Campaign Media Analysis Group and CNN 's consultant on political advertising .
`` The Norton ad is the most direct so far that we 've seen ; however it 's likely the first of many ads by Republicans who will try and use the president and his sagging poll numbers to nationalize the mid-term elections by attaching Obama to their races and opponents .
`` Ironically the political attack on Obama comes on the same day the president issued an executive order that formally creates a bipartisan fiscal commission , a first step to forcing difficult decisions needed to get the U.S. debt load under control .
Following the events for Sen. Bennet , the president travels to Las Vegas , Nevada , where he 'll headline a fundraising dinner for the Democratic National Committee .
Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid team up at a town hall Friday on the economy where they 'll take questions from citizens and business leaders .
Obama will also visit the local chamber of commerce .
The Nevada Democrat is battling this year for a fifth term in the Senate .
While he 's raised a large amount of campaign cash , polls of Nevada voters indicate that Reid faces a very tough re-election .
