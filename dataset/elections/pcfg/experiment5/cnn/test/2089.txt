Michele Bachmann may be struggling in national polls , but the Republican presidential candidate has faced tougher obstacles or so her new memoir strives to show .
Core of Conviction , released Monday , shows a resilient and conservative Midwesterner called to serve in the highest office .
Bachmann describes her process of deciding to run as a largely spiritual one .
Bachmann describes past defeats , including a local school board race , but spends an equal amount of space describing come-from-behind wins something she ll have to repeat if she hopes to become the 2012 GOP nominee .
During her re-election race in 2008 , which Bachmann won by three points , the Minnesota congresswoman says she learned to play the hard-fought game of politics .
From this close-call experience I learned some valuable lessons , Bachmann writes .
As I have said , in politics I wanted to be able to disagree with opponents without being disagreeable or disrespectful .
Yet in the stormy years to come , many more hardballs would come they come with the territory of politics .
But the 2008 campaign gave me an opportunity to learn to do better .
The 2012 race , Bachmann writes , requires a fresh effort by Republicans to appeal to groups not traditionally included in conservative appeals .
I believe that a conventional , play-it-safe campaign will ensure that America has to endure another four years of Barack Obama and his wrecking-crew policies , Bachmann writes .
That is , if the Republican presidential nominee fails to energize key constituencies , or worse , if the nominee is seen as insincere , then we will lose .
While there are few details of the 2012 campaign , Bachmann does describe her feeling when details of her migraines became public this summer .
She writes she was reluctant to cite sexism as a factor , but that it appeared political foes were maybe playing the gender card .
After all , at one time or another , all of us , both men and women , suffer pain and get sick .
Core of Conviction also offers Bachmann s own candid views of her political peers , including former Pres. George W. Bush , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and House Majority Leader John Boehner Bachmann also says she would have preferred if Hillary Clinton , a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 , had eventually become president rather than Obama , saying the former senator and first lady was less leftist revolutionary than Obama , and that if Sen. John McCain couldn t be in the mix I would have wanted Mrs. Clinton .
Bachmann s book also offers a glimpse into the candidate s childhood , including the triumph of making her high school cheerleading squad , and the disappointment of not being invited to her senior prom .
Bachmann s book is published by Sentinel , a conservative imprint of Penguin .
