One day before a CNN\/WMUR\/New Hampshire Union Leader Republican presidential debate , a new national poll suggests that when it comes to the next election for the White House , Republicans put winning over ideological purity .
According to a CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Sunday morning , three-quarters of Republicans and GOP leaning independent voters say they want a party nominee who can defeat President Barack Obama in 2012 , even if that person does n't agree with them on every issue .
That 's up seven percentage points from January .
The poll also indicates that the two best-known potential GOP presidential hopefuls - Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani - are also the ones with the highest favorable rating among Republicans .
`` That may explain why they feel they can wait before throwing their hats in the ring , '' says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
Both the former Alaska governor and the former New York City mayor say they are considering bids for the GOP nomination , but neither to date has taken concrete steps towards a presidential run .
According to the survey , the highest unfavorable ratings among Republicans go to Rep. Ron Paul of Texas and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who are each disliked by about a quarter of the voters .
More than half of all Republicans do n't have an opinion of former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania , former Utah Gov. and U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman or businessman and radio talk show host Herman Cain .
`` The race may ultimately be shaped by the unknowns in the field , underscoring the importance of CNN 's debate on Monday night , '' adds Holland .
The poll takes a closer look at how Republicans perceive the five best-known candidates or potential candidates for the nomination .
Two-thirds say that Romney can beat the president in the general election ; a majority also say that about Giuliani , but most Republicans think that Obama would beat Palin , Gingrich or Paul .
Who is qualified to be president ? .
According to the survey , three-quarters say that Giuliani and Romney are qualified ; six in 10 say the same about Palin , but she still lags well behind on that score .
Palin 's big advantage is the perception that she is not a typical politician .
Seven in 10 Republicans feel that way about the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee .
Most of those questioned see Romney as a typical politician .
Eight in 10 say that Palin agrees with them on issues that they care about the most .
A respectable 64 percent feel the same way about Romney , but that still gives Palin an advantage on issues , and on values as well - nearly eight in 10 say that she represent the values of Republicans like themselves .
