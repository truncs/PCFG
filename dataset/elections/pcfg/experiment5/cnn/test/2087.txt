Iran says it has busted a U.S. espionage network , arresting 24 people accused of spying and identifying 42 CIA operatives linked to the operation , state-run Press TV reported , citing an Iranian intelligence ministry statement .
The statement said the operatives had gathered data from `` universities and scientific research centers , and in the field of nuclear energy , aerospace , defense and biotechnology industries . ''
The alleged spy ring also used U.S. embassies and consulates in several countries , particularly Turkey , Malaysia , and the United Arab Emirates to cull information about the `` oil and gas pipelines , telecommunication and electricity networks , airports and customs , the security of the banking and communication systems . ''
`` The network , which was set up by a considerable number of seasoned CIA operatives in several countries , attempted to trick citizens into spying for them under the guise of issuing visa , helping with permanent residency , and making job and study offers , '' the report said .
The Iranian and U.S. governments have been adversaries since the 1979 Iranian revolution that toppled the shah of Iran and ushered in a hard-line and theocratic Islamic republic .
Today , the United States says Iran aspires to build nuclear weapons and backs terrorism in the Middle East -- stances Tehran denies .
Iran repeatedly has accused the CIA of trying to undermine the government , and news reports surfaced during the George W. Bush administration of an escalation in U.S. covert operations to undermine the regime .
Last year , for example , police arrested several suspects allegedly connected to the CIA , Israel 's Mossad and the British M-16 who were behind `` recent terrorist attacks '' targeting Iranian nuclear scientists , Iranian media reported .
In another 2010 bust , seven people , including some accused of having ties to a U.S.-backed Farsi-language radio station , were arrested .
Iran 's state-owned Press TV reported that two CIA operatives were among the group .
In 2009 , Iranian authorities said it arrested four citizens who were paid by the U.S. government to bring about a regime change .
It said the group was funded by the State Department and the CIA .
The U.S. did not acknowledge those reports or the new claims from Saturday .
Also , an Iranian diplomat in June 2009 said that the United States may have been behind the killing of Neda Agha-Soltan , the 26-year-old Iranian woman whose fatal shooting was captured on video , making her an instant symbol of the opposition movement that protested against the June 12 presidential election results .
A CIA spokesman said at the time that `` any suggestion that the CIA was responsible for the death of this young woman is wrong , absurd and offensive . ''
