Looks like the Donald Trump-Jon Huntsman feud wo n't be over anytime soon -- especially on the question of whether the Republican presidential candidate tried to meet with the real estate mogul to seek his endorsement .
`` I called his office one time , '' Huntsman told NBC on Tuesday , `` when he got out of the race -- as I did Tim Pawlenty -- just as a gesture of kindness .
`` But Trump says Huntsman was looking for more .
`` Every candidate , virtually , has come up to my office , and they do n't want my money -- they want my endorsement , '' Trump said on Fox and Friends Tuesday .
`` He asked to come and see me .
And I said , you know -- really , I just sort of turned him down in a very nice way , and now , all of a sudden , look what happens .
`` Huntsman also made his feelings clear on the upcoming Trump-moderated presidential debate , calling the idea `` a joke . ''
`` The presidency of the United States of America is beyond reality shows , '' he told NBC .
`` So , you 'll have two or three people go on , and then Mr. Trump will weigh in after in terms of who he thinks he 'll want to support ? .
This is about politics as show business . ''
`` He 's not in the debate because his ratings are so low , '' Trump fired back , referring to a candidate forum on Fox News ' `` Huckabee '' over the weekend , in which Huntsman did not participate .
`` I mean , he has just such low polling numbers that he was canceled out of Saturday night 's debate . ''
Trump , who 's hosting the debate on Dec. 27 with Newsmax and ION Television -- just one week before the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses , has received a `` yes '' to attend from candidates Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum .
Huntsman and Ron Paul have said they will not attend while others are still mulling a decision .
Trump claims his debate will be a ratings bonanza , and consequently , a valuable vehicle for the candidates .
`` We 're going to have a real debate , '' he said .
`` It 'll be some good entertainment , which I do n't want to say , but you still need it .
But more importantly , we 're going to get some of the issues out that are important . ''
But not everyone is swayed by Trump 's would-be kingmaking prowess .
Arizona Sen. John McCain , the 2008 Republican presidential nominee , said he thought the candidates are so preoccupied with attending debates they are losing focus on their races .
He said the Trump debate wo n't add to the objective of getting nominated .
`` It 's their decision , but I do think that on Dec. .
