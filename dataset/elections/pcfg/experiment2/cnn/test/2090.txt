For a second straight day , Jon Huntsman is going after his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination .
Huntsman , who taped the interview with Morgan on Friday , added that `` you can fault the Fed , you know , they 've only got so many tools with which - with which to draw their policy options .
But treasonous , I think , is a little bit beyond . ''
Huntsman does n't believe that Romney , a fellow Mormon , is the right person to take on President Barack Obama in next year 's general election .
The former Utah governor said he thinks Romney 's a good man who has a terrific family `` but when it comes to going up against Barack Obama in an election cycle that is going to be 100 percent about expanding the economy and creating jobs , being number 47 as job creator ai n't going to cut it .
We were number one in job creation .
I think that works .
`` Huntsman also criticized Romney for the Massachusetts health care plan that Romney signed into law five years ago when he was the state 's governor , a plan than many people say was the inspiration for national health care law that last year passed by a Democratic Congress and signed into law by President Obama .
`` Creating Obamacare before Obama , the most despised and reviled health care legislation in the history of this country , does n't cut it , and I think that will be terribly problematic , '' said Huntsman .
The comments come one day after Huntsman said on ABC 's `` This Week '' that the rest of the GOP presidential field had `` zero substance .
`` As for his campaign for the nomination , Huntsman , who is registering low in the national polls and in surveys in the key early voting states , says that `` I think we 're right on the issues , and I think we 're at the center right of the political scale , which is exactly where this country is .
`` Asked by Morgan if he 'd be willing to serve as Mitt Romney 's running mate , should Romney win the nomination , Huntsman said `` There would be too many jokes about that .
No , I ca n't imagine it at all . ''
But he did n't close the door to possibly serving as running mate to Bachmann , saying `` if you love this country , you serve this country .
Every time I 've been asked to serve over different administrations , from Reagan to the two Bushes , to President Obama , I have the same , the same answer , and that is if you love this country , you serve her .
And so , you know , if you 're in a position to better the country , to bring whatever background you have to bear , whatever experiences to use in fine-tuning our future , I 'll be the first person to sign up , absolutely .
