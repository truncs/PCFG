Hollywood star Elizabeth Taylor had a lesser-known side as political activist and politician 's wife .
Taylor , who died today at 79 , married her sixth husband , former Republican Senator John Warner in 1976 , and was an active figure during his 1978 campaign .
The glamour Taylor brought to the campaign trail was said to have helped Warner gain the popularity that ultimately helped him win the seat as Virginia 's senator .
For five years , Taylor played the role of Washington political wife until the couple 's divorce in 1982 .
The two stayed close .
`` We were friends until the end , '' Warner told CNN .
`` She was my partner in what appeared to be an impossible challenge for the United States Senate .
Hand in hand we marched off with no campaign stamps , no funds were raised and we had but nine weeks to put together a campaign which we did and won it narrowly and that laid the foundation for a career , '' Warner told MSNBC .
Warner retired from his senate seat in 2009 , after a 30-year career as the second-longest serving senator in Virginia 's history .
Almost a decade later , Taylor was back in Washington , this time in connection to her AIDS and HIV support efforts .
Warner hosted a Capitol Hill reception in 1986 for Taylor when she testified before Congress in a lobbying effort for greater AIDS research funding .
Taylor would often find herself back in Washington to receive various awards for her philanthropic work .
In 2001 , President Bill Clinton presented her a Presidential Citizens medal .
In 2002 , Taylor was granted the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts .
Taylor was an avid Hillary Clinton supporter during the 2008 presidential race and donated the legal maximum of $ 4,600 to Clinton 's campaign .
`` I have contributed to Sen. Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign because she has a mind of her own and a very strong one at that , '' Taylor said in 2007 .
`` I like the way she thinks .
She is very savvy and a smart leader with years of experience in government , diplomacy and politics . ''
`` With the passing of Elizabeth Taylor , America has lost one of its greatest talents and fiercest advocates for HIV\/AIDS research . .
We were honored to host her at the White House in 2001 when she received the Presidential Citizens Medal for her relentless crusade for more AIDS research and better care .
In founding amfAR , she raised both millions of dollars and our level of awareness about the impact of AIDS in the United States and around the world , '' Hillary Clinton said in joint statement with President Clinton .
