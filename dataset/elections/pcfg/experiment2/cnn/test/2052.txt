Tea Party Express chairwoman says Murkowski does n't `` get it `` Murkowski `` was fired by the people , '' says Amy KremerStrom Thurmond is the only senator to ever win as a write-in candidateMurkowski 's candidacy could split the Republican vote and help McAdams -- Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski , who lost in the Republican primary last month , says she will launch a write-in campaign to retain her senate seat .
`` Today , my friends , my campaign for Alaska begins , '' Murkowski told a room full of supporters in Anchorage on Friday .
`` My heart is Alaska , and I can not leave you .
I can not stop what we have started , '' the Republican senator added .
Murkowski also called on thousands of Alaskans who did not vote in the primary to join her renewed campaign .
`` It 's a futile effort on her part , it really is , '' former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin told reporters Friday in Des Moines , in between signing copies of her book for fans after a high-profile speech to the Iowa Republican Party .
`` She certainly has the right to do so , but Joe Miller is the right person to lead the state and this country , '' added Palin , who backed Miller , a one-time long shot and attorney with a sizable bank of Tea Party credentials .
Miller is now considered the favorite in the November general election against Scott McAdams , the Democratic nominee and mayor of Sitka , Alaska .
Tea Party Express Chairwoman Amy Kremer , whose group campaigned heavily for Murkowski 's primary opponent -- and eventual primary winner -- Miller , said the senator 's decision proves she does n't `` get it . ''
`` She was fired by the people .
The people were given a choice and they voted for somebody else , '' she said , adding that she was shocked to learn of Murkowski 's decision .
Murkowski , whose write-in campaign could change the tenor of the race , but not if Kremer has anything to do with it .
Her group worked hard to push Miller across the finish line , endorsing him in June , sending people to scour the state in his support and spending nearly $ 600,000 to help his campaign .
Kremer said the Tea Party Express thought it was done with Miller 's campaign and that he would be a shoo-in in November .
Murkowski 's decision changes things .
`` Oh , I 'm sure we 'll be back up there at some point , '' she said .
Brian Walsh , spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee , on Thursday urged Murkowski -- part of a political dynasty in Alaska -- to back Miller .
`` Alaska 's voters have spoken , and have chosen Joe Miller as their Republican U.S. Senate nominee , '' he said in a statement .
