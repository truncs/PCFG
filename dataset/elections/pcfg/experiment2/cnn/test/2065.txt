Sen. Lisa Murkowski 's bid to become only the second person to win a write-in campaign for U.S. Senate appeared on track in Alaska early Wednesday , with write-in candidates leading a Tea Party-backed Republican who beat her in a primary .
But even if the write-ins remained ahead of Republican nominee Joe Miller and Democratic candidate Scott McAdams , the outcome of Alaska 's Tuesday general election apparently would n't be known for days , because officials need to determine which write-in votes actually went to Murkowski .
`` We are in the process of making history , '' Murkowski , who is seeking a second full term , said early Wednesday .
Although Murkowski told supporters in Anchorage , Alaska , late Tuesday that the outcome was n't yet known , she was clearly optimistic about her chances .
`` They said you ca n't do it , -LRB- that -RRB- you ca n't win a write-in campaign , not in Alaska , not anywhere .
They said we ca n't do it , '' Murkowski said .
`` Do they know Alaska ? . ''
With 73 percent of precincts reporting , write-in candidates as a group had 40 percent of the vote , with Miller collecting 35 percent and McAdams 24 percent , according to an unofficial count from The Associated Press .
Alaska had dozens of eligible write-in candidates .
Officials did n't plan to read the write-in votes until November 18 , in part because they need to wait for mail-in votes , according to the state 's election division .
With a victory , Murkowski would avenge her August primary loss to Miller in the latest chapter of a feud between her and his main backers , including the Tea Party Express and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
She told CNN Wednesday morning that , although she was n't her party 's nominee , she intended to caucus with Republicans should she win .
`` This is about a can-do people , '' Murkowski told her supporters late Tuesday .
`` When they tell us we ca n't do something , what do we do ? .
We stand up just a little bit straighter , just a little bit taller , and we take it on . ''
`` We 're doing it for Alaska , for our kids , for our families , for the people in this state , because this is the right thing to do , '' she added .
The Tea Party Express , a national Tea Party organization based in Sacramento , California , endorsed Miller earlier this summer and spent nearly $ 600,000 during the primary campaign to help him defeat Murkowski .
The primary race was so close , with Miller eventually garnering 51 percent , that Murkowski did n't concede until a week after the vote , while absentee ballots were still being counted .
She announced a write-in candidacy in September .
