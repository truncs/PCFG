Mike Lee captured the GOP Senate nomination in Utah Tuesday night .
- A Tea Party backed candidate in Utah is a major step closer Wednesday morning to joining the U.S. Senate .
Mike Lee , a 38 year old attorney , captured the GOP Senate nomination in Utah Tuesday , edging out fellow conservative Tim Bridgewater , in a battle to succeed another Republican , Sen. Bob Bennett .
With 99 percent of precincts reporting , Lee beat Bridgewater 51 percent to 49 percent , according to a vote count by Associated Press .
`` We had an army of hard-fighting , hard-campaigning volunteers and they just refused to quit because they believed in our message , '' said Lee late Tuesday night , according to local reports .
Bridgewater , a businessman , and Lee finished first and second , respectively last month at the Utah Republican Party convention , advancing to Tuesday 's primary .
Bridgewater and Lee touted themselves as more reliable conservatives than Bennett , who finished third in the voting by delegates , eliminating him from advancing to the primary and ending his chances of re-election for a fourth term .
Bennett became the first sitting senator to go down to defeat in a primary season marked by strong anti-incumbent sentiment .
After deciding not to mount a write-in campaign , Bennett endorsed Bridgewater , who was also backed the day before the primary by the leader of a Utah based Tea Party group .
Lee , a one-time clerk for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito , grabbed the endorsement of the Tea Party Express , which launched a radio campaign and a get out the vote effort to assist the candidate .
The Tea Party Express , a national group based in California that 's best known for its three national bus tours , recently pumped more than $ 500,000 into the recent fight for the Republican Senate nomination in neighboring Nevada , helping transform ex-state lawmaker Sharron Angle , once considered a long shot , into an easy winner in a primary election held earlier this month .
`` We are so excited to see another tea party candidate win a critical election , and the voters in Utah will be well-served with Mike Lee in the U.S. Senate , '' said Tea Party Express Political Director Bryan Shroyer , in a statement .
Lee also won the endorsement of Rep. Ron Paul of Texas .
The former GOP presidential candidate is a leading figure in the libertarian movement .
Bennett upset many conservatives with his 2007 vote for President Bush 's plan for a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants and his 2008 vote for the federal bailout of banks and financial institutions .
