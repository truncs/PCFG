The ever-confident Newt Gingrich thinks he 'll maintain his newfound frontrunner status , unlike other GOP presidential contenders whose boomlets have fallen flat .
Gingrich has been on the rise , thanks in part to solid debate performances that have highlighted his intellectual , matter-of-fact approach to issues .
An influx of campaign cash has allowed the once-fledgling presidential candidate to build up `` dramatically more robust '' operations in the early primary and caucus states of Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina , where he stands a chance to emerge as the conservative alternative to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
`` We have a larger team here than any other candidate and have a bigger ground game , and have a huge tea party support here and I 'm going to continue to campaign very aggressively here in South Carolina , '' Gingrich said .
Less than two months ago , Gingrich was attending more intimate campaign events in South Carolina .
They centered on his documentary and books , as well as his wife Callista 's children 's book about America exceptionalism .
The main character , Ellis the Elephant , would show up in costume .
On his three-day campaign swing through the first southern primary state this week , Gingrich is addressing crowds in the hundreds , and his wife is doing separate book events .
As enthusiastic as the crowds appear , skepticism remains whether Gingrich can sustain the momentum , clinch the nomination and beat President Barack Obama .
During a town hall event outside on the Bluffton Promenade , one man asked the White House hopeful : `` I 'm concerned about the election .
My goal is to singularly remove Obama from the presidency , and I 'm concerned that we wo n't pick up the independents and I need to know how you 're going to do that , because that 's who I 'm going to support .
`` Gingrich assured the crowd he was designing a campaign to create a crushing defeat and , by October , `` no Democrat can say with a straight face they 're going to vote for Obama . ''
`` A lot of Republicans have this goofy idea , and a lot in the news media tries to sell us on this goofy idea , that what you really need to do to get independents is move to the center .
You have to understand how they define center , '' Gingrich said .
The center is 50 .
I like picking fights where I 'm at 80 percent .
That means even after Obama spends his billion dollars and lies about it we 'll still be at 65 % .
I do n't think we 'll get 65 % .
I think 60 would be a more than admirable goal for next year , and that will be enough to win a crushing election .
