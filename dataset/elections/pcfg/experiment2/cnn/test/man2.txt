Republican presidential contender Herman Cain emerged from an especially tame debate with Newt Gingrich late Saturday and attempted to end the controversy surrounding him .
Facing questions about the sexual harassment allegations against him , Cain was defiant : scolding reporters , picking which of their questions he would answer , and - at one point - entirely shutting down a reporter 's query .
`` Do n't even go there , '' Cain told the questioner who 'd asked about the allegations .
`` Can I ask my question ? . ''
the reporter said .
`` No , '' Cain responded .
`` Where 's my chief of staff ? .
Please send him the journalistic code of ethics .
`` The tense back-and-forth happened during a news conference moments after Cain and Gingrich appeared on stage together .
Their event was billed as a debate on entitlement spending , but was marked with so much congeniality between the two that it turned out to be more of a friendly discussion .
It took place in The Woodlands , Texas , was sponsored by the Texas Patriot PAC - a tea party group - and featured Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa as one of two men teeing up questions on Social Security , Medicaid and Medicare for the candidates .
At the news conference , Cain fielded questions that were to his liking , before and after batting away the first one regarding the harassment allegations .
For example , after shutting down the reporter 's query , Cain pointed to one man who 'd previously identified himself as a Cain `` fan '' and asked : `` You want to ask another good question ? . .
`` Yes , '' the man said , asking Cain if he would try to `` legislate from the Oval Office like Mr. Obama . ''
`` That is a good question , '' Cain began his response .
Moments later , reporters again pressed the candidate .
`` Mr. Cain - do you think you can just not answer questions about the sexual harassment claims ? . ''
one journalist said .
`` Are you never going to answer questions about this ever again , Mr. Cain ? . ''
another asked .
Cain , sitting at a table , pushed back from it and began to walk toward the door .
But he stopped short .
`` If you all just listen , for 30 seconds - I will explain this one time ... I was going to do something that my staff told me not to do and try to respond , '' Cain said .
He continued : `` What I 'm saying is this - we are getting back on message , end of story .
Back on message .
Read all of the other accounts , where everything has been answered - end of story .
`` Cain has denied allegations , first reported in Politico , that he sexually harassed two women in the 1990 's as head of the National Restaurant Association .
