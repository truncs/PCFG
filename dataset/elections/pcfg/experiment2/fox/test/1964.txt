President Obama campaign found plenty of enthusiasm among students in the 2008 presidential race , but 2010 is another year -- and with seats to fill at a Tuesday rally at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , the Obama team took the step of sending an e-mail message to supporters in search of an audience .
The president is headed to Madison as part of a series of rallies in swing states leading up to the election .
But where he drew a crowd of 17,000 at the University of Wisconsin in 2008 during the presidential race , crowds are expected to be significantly smaller this time around -- so much so that the president 's campaign team , Organizing for America , is sending out RSVP requests for Tuesday 's rally , featuring musician Ben Harper .
`` We 've got a lot of work to do between now and November 2nd to keep moving America forward .
But this movement has never backed down from a tough fight .
I hope you can join me .
If you have n't already , please RSVP here .
Hope to see you there , President Barack Obama , '' reads the e-mail distributed Monday by Organizing for America .
According to The Washington Post , the students at University of Wisconsin-Madison are typical of the enthusiasm gap that Democrats recognize is eating away at their chance to keep the majority in Congress .
David Plouffe , a Democratic election adviser and the president 's 2008 campaign manager , told the Post said he recognizes 2010 is n't going to mimic 2008 `` That 's not going to happen , '' he acknowledged .
`` We 're not dealing with a fantasy scenario here .
We 're saying with some small improvement , races where you 're losing 52 to 48 , you can flip it .
`` But while the administration recognizes Obama won big on the backs of college students in 2008 , it has more than a ways to go to make up for the traditionally lazy voting demographic in a year when he 's not on the ballot and his policies are looking like liabilities to the water-bearers who carried them .
It may take more than a four-percentage-point `` flip '' for Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold to turn around this election year .
The three-term Democratic senator finds himself in a surprisingly tight race against businessman Ron Johnson , who 's up 8 percentage points in a RealClearPolitics average of polls .
Several other races are showing similar differences .
