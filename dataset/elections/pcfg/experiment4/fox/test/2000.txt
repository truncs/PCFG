You can practically hear the crickets in Hollywood.Com pared to the presidential election of 2008 , when celebrities from Oprah Winfrey to Ben Affleck to Robert DeNiro went all out for Barack Obama , the stars are staying home during the 2010 midterm election push , experts say .
There is definitely an enthusiasm gap among celebrities this election cycle , '' Matthew Vadum , senior editor at the Capital Research Center in Washington , D.C. , told Pop Tarts .
Now that there is no George W. Bush to demonize , it is hard for most celebrities to get excited about the off-year congressional election .
`` Or maybe the silence is a sign that the Obama administration isn t living up to Hollywood 's expectations .
The more left-wing of the celebrities feel that Obama and the Democratic Congress haven t been liberal enough , no climate legislation , etc. -RRB- and are therefore part of the enthusiasm gap , explained Stephen Zunes , a Professor of Politics & International Studies at the University of San Francisco .
Another possible reason that celebrities aren t voicing their political opinions so prominently this time around is that the main campaign issue -- unemployment -- isn t a `` social issue '' they can champion .
Celebrities are in an industry which always leads to unemployment every job ends .
But they definitely aren t as fiscally liberal as they are socially liberal , said Ange-Mare Hancock , professor of Political Science at the University of Southern California .
Nonetheless , staying silent doesn t mean that big players aren t showing their support monetarily .
Kiefer Sutherland , Jamie Foxx , Melanie Griffith and Seth Rogen each donated $ 30,400 to the Democratic National Committee , George Clooney donated $ 5,000 , Barbra Streisand gave $ 10,000 , and Steven Spielberg dished out $ 15,200 , as well $ 10,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign .
Meanwhile Avatar director James Cameron gave $ 1 million to the campaign to defeat Proposition 23 , a California ballot initiative to suspend the state 's global warming law .
And Rock the Vote spokesperson Maegan Carberry said her organization , which seeks to engage and build political power in young people , sees the celebrity spirit very much alive for the midterms .
Plenty of stars have worked with us this cycle ; it s all just much more visible when the country is focused on a major race like the presidency , '' she told Pop Tarts .
`` This is about local politics , and we are seeing local media markets pick up our public service ads .
