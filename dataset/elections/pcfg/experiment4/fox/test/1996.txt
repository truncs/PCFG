President Obama , after spending weeks on the campaign trail stumping for Democrats and warning about the damage Republicans would do with a congressional majority , heads into bunker-mode Monday to wait out the storm .
Democratic leaders publicly predict they 'll scrape by on Tuesday , holding on to the House and Senate while defying assumptions about the strength of a conservative wave that has swept the country since shortly after Obama took the oath of office .
But GOP officials are confident and forecast a nationwide rebuke of the president 's policies in the form of dozens of pickups which could hand them one , if not both , chambers .
Though top Democratic surrogates are still on the campaign trail in a final push for votes , the president has no public plans on the eve of election .
Obama was scheduled for two closed-press briefings Monday , while White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and other advisers spoke with the press off-camera about trade with Asia .
Gibbs , who did not schedule a daily briefing on camera Monday , noted that the president will tape several syndicated radio interviews Monday , most of which will air Tuesday , and he will make calls to Democratic volunteers and activists in Florida , New Hampshire , New Mexico and Hawaii Monday night .
On the docket for Obama 's taped appearances were interviews with Ryan Seacrest , Russ Parr and Steve Harvey .
According to spokesman Josh Earnest , he did local radio interviews in the morning with hosts in Cincinnati , Milwaukee and Philadelphia .
The president is leaving on Friday for a 10-day trip to Asia that includes economic meetings with the G-20 industrialized nations meeting in South Korea and an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Japan .
Deflecting a linkage between the impending election and the president 's focus on the international economy , Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs Mike Froman said regardless of the election results , the president is going to Asia to expand export opportunities and jobs at home .
`` This agenda is critical to our economy back here at home , to our recovery and our ability to increase exports and create well-paying jobs here at home , '' Froman told reporters .
`` That will be his agenda regardless of election outcome .
`` The president made his closing argument Sunday afternoon at a Democratic National Committee rally in Cleveland , where he repeated his favorite piece of political imagery .
`` We ca n't give them the keys back .
They do n't know how to drive , '' Obama said to applause .
