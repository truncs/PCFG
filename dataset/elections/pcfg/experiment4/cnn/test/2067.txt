Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 's presidential campaign said Wednesday it will aim to raise $ 50 million for his campaign to win the Republican presidential nomination .
Earlier on Wednesday the Romney campaign announced it had raised $ 18.25 million in the past three months , putting the former Massachusetts governor far ahead of his GOP rivals in the battle for campaign cash .
Romney 's campaign also reported that as of July 1 they have $ 12.6 million in the bank , and that all the money raised in this year 's second quarter is for the primaries rather than the general election .
The campaign added that funds were raised in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .
`` Voters are responding to Mitt Romney 's message that President Obama 's policies have failed and that we need new leadership in Washington .
Our fundraising for the second quarter represents the strong support Mitt Romney has across the country , '' said Romney for President National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick , in a statement .
More than half of the money raised in the April through June period was brought in or pledged during a one-day phone bank fundraiser held in Las Vegas on May 16 .
Last week Romney aides predicted the campaign would bring in between $ 15 - $ 20 million .
Romney 's figures put him far ahead of his rivals who have reported their second quarter numbers .
Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , who 's making his third bid for the White House , reported raising $ 4.5 million .
Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty reported bringing in $ 4.2 million , with former Utah Gov. and former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman raising $ 4.1 million .
Huntsman did n't announce his candidacy until June 21 , late in the second quarter .
Nearly half of haul was a donation of his own money .
Former Godfather 's Pizza CEO and radio talk show host Herman Cain reported raising $ 2.46 million , which also included some self funding .
Romney did not make any personal contributions to his campaign during the past three months .
In first bid for the GOP nomination four years ago , he raised $ 65.1 million and in addition loaned his campaign $ 42.3 million .
Romney 's $ 18.25 million brought in the past three months is lower than the $ 23.4 million he raised in the first three months of 2007 , a comparable quarter from his first run for the presidency .
Among those who have yet to report their fundraising numbers are Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , who has jumped in the polls since her performance at a CNN\/WMUR\/New Hampshire Union Leader presidential debate last month .
Bachmann 's campaign says they 'll reveal their figures on July 15 , the filing deadline for the second quarter .
