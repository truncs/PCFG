Former Rep. J.D. Hayworth will formally launch his campaign on Monday .
The Republican Party 's most recent presidential nominee has earned a primary challenge from the right on President 's Day .
J.D. Hayworth , a former Arizona congressman and radio host , formally announced Monday that 's he 's challenging Republican John McCain for his U.S. Senate seat .
`` You could say they are two John McCains .
The one who campaigns like a conservative and the one who legislates like a liberal , '' said Hayworth at a news conference at his new campaign office in Phoenix .
`` We all love and think the world of John and John 's place in history is secure , '' the 51-year old Hayworth told CNN correspondent Casey Wian on Friday .
`` But John no longer represents the common sense conservative philosophy that most Arizonans share .
`` McCain , 73 , is running for a fifth term in the Senate .
The 2008 GOP presidential nominee served six years in the House before winning election to the Senate in 1986 .
McCain has n't faced a difficult re-election since 1992 .
Hayworth 's Web page bills him as `` The Consistent Conservative , '' challenging McCain on health care reform , the national debt and illegal immigration .
And a Hayworth press release from Friday mentions that McCain `` voted for the massive bank bailout bill in 2008 , which included $ 150 billion in earmarks .
`` McCain , meanwhile , is in the middle of an eight-day campaign swing through the state .
Asked by a reporter if Hayworth was getting some grassroots conservative support , McCain said `` I do n't know what kind of support that Mr. Hayworth has .
I have n't seen much so far , but maybe I missed it .
And the voters in his district threw him out in 2006 , in a heavy Republican district .
`` At a campaign event Monday in Tempe , Arizona , where he received the official backing of 31 mayors from across the state , McCain said `` I intend to go out there and earn every single vote .
`` McCain also told CNN that `` I 'm tenacious , I fight and I love a good campaign .
`` Over the past few weeks , McCain has announced endorsements from top conservatives like Dick Armey of FreedomWorks and Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform .
Last month , McCain 's 2008 running mate , former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , announced that she would travel to Arizona to campaign with McCain in late March .
Palin 's popularity with voters on the right could help McCain with some Republican voters who question his commitment to conservative values and goals .
Sen. Scott Brown , whose victory in last month 's special senate election in Massachusetts energized the GOP , has also said he 'll stump with McCain early next month .
