Latest polls show the Democrats ' position stabilizing .
Voters prefer Democrats on a wide range of issues , he saysAlex Castellanos : There 's a strong wave of voters seeking changeHe says he thinks voters want to slam on the brakes on big government Editor 's note : There are 29 days to go before voters cast ballots in the hotly contested midterm elections .
In this special feature , CNN 's political contributors share their quick thoughts on what 's making news .
Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist , was a political consultant for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House .
Alex Castellanos , a Republican strategist , was a campaign consultant for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 's 2008 presidential campaign .
PAUL BEGALA : Signs of a closer electionIf the old saw is true that in politics a week is a lifetime , we have four lifetimes before Americans go to the polls .
Nearly all the indicators point to major GOP gains this fall , and for all of 2010 I 've been telling Democrats to build an ark .
But as we enter the final month of the campaign , there are signs that perhaps the Democrats ' position has stabilized .
The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows that Americans are evenly split as to whether they want Democrats or Republicans to control Congress .
In fact , 15 percent of Americans give the Dems a `` very positive '' rating , while Republicans garner a `` very positive '' rating from just 8 percent of Americans .
Meanwhile , the latest Newsweek survey shows Dems leading Repubs on nearly all major issues , from unemployment to federal spending , to Social Security .
None of this is to say Democrats are surging -- that would overstate it .
But Tea Party conservatives like Rand Paul in Kentucky , Sharron Angle in Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado have not been able to close the deal .
It may just be that voters are getting a bit of buyer 's remorse .
If Democrats can stop playing defense and start attacking Republicans , this may be a closer election than anyone thought .
ALEX CASTELLANOS : Huge wave of voters seek changeTwo years ago , President Obama was elected on the promise of hope and change .
All we knew then was what change was n't : George Bush .
Two years later , Americans are finally telling Washington what `` change '' is .
Democratic leaders say they are getting the message : Change is `` more '' -- more spending , government growth and economic intervention .
Republicans say change should be `` less , '' not more , of what Washington 's been doing the past two years .
Is change an accelerator or a brake pedal ? .
I think voters are slamming on the brakes but , hey , you are driving .
