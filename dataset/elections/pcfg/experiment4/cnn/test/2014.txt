Even before he was officially declared president , Michel Martelly was making the rounds in Washington .
The bad boy of Haitian music was not going to waste a minute in starting the job of a lifetime , something particularly daunting in Haiti , where past administrations stand accused of massive corruption and fraud .
His supporters say they elected him for being an outsider .
They believed his promises that he would lead his nation out of despair .
Now he appears ready to show them tangible proof that Haiti is finally moving forward .
He said he had already begun doing just that on his trip to Washington .
`` The message I am carrying back is that the international world , the financial institutions are ready to back up this new government , '' Martelly told CNN Thursday as he prepared to return home .
`` It is important to rebuild confidence and trust in this process , '' he said .
`` And that can only be done through transparency . ''
As a first step , Martelly proposed setting up an e-governance system that would enable ordinary Haitians to access information on a website and even post complaints or expose fraud anonymously .
`` We will also do it by example , '' he said .
`` The government has not served its people .
It has been 14 months since the earthquake and people are still living in tents . ''
Martelly met Wednesday with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and officials at the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Banks .
Those meetings came before Haiti 's election council officially declared him the winner Wednesday night with 67.67 % of the presidential vote , finally ending a balloting process that began in late-November and was drawn out by irregularities .
Martelly responded to the announcement on Twitter .
`` Begin to take our tools , to clean our country , to get to work , '' he said in Creole .
Speaking to reporters Thursday at the National Press Club , Martelly said his meeting with Clinton was `` productive . ''
`` We discussed ways of streamlining U.S. aid to Haiti , '' he said .
`` We will strengthen our partnership with the United States and its people .
As President Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton stated many times , we need to strengthen the capacity of Haitian institutions so they can answer to the needs of the Haitian people . ''
Martelly 's candidacy was unexpected -- he was better known as Sweet Micky , the kompa singer with flamboyant stage presence .
He appealed to voters who had grown weary with the status quo and what they perceived as a lack of progress after the devastating 2010 earthquake .
`` The reconstruction process is despairingly slow , '' he said Wednesday , citing it as a key complaint of the electorate .
