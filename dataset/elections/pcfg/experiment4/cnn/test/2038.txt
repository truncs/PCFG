Meghan McCain has released a new book that chronicles her experiences on the campaign trail .
- Sarah Palin was the `` Time Bomb '' in Sen. John McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign writes his daughter , Meghan McCain , in a new book released Tuesday .
In the book , `` Dirty Sexy Politics , '' the McCain offspring sounds off on the former Alaska governor and the surprise Republican nominee for vice president .
`` I called her ` the Time Bomb , ' '' she writes of Palin .
`` From the minute Sarah arrived the campaign began splitting apart .
And rather than joining us , and our campaign , she seemed only to begin her own .
`` Early on Meghan McCain confesses , `` In my heart of hearts I 'd always hoped my father would pick Senator Joe Lieberman . ''
Later , she likens the selection of Sarah Palin , a decision she learned of through news coverage , to playing roulette .
Discomfort and doubt accompanied Palin 's addition to the Republican presidential ticket for Meghan McCain , who writes of how her own certainty that her father would clinch the Republican nomination and presidential win before the vice presidential pick began to wane .
She takes a swing at McCain campaign architect Steve Schmidt 's handling of the Palin choice for the vice presidential nod .
`` How the Palin selection process and announcement had been handled seemed to highlight things that were innately wrong with our campaign and with the tactics of Steve Schmidt .
It was a risky move one of those things that can wind up being genius or the stupidest decision of all time .
`` And later in the book : `` There was a fine line between genius and insanity , they say , and choosing her as the running mate was starting to seem like the definition of that line .
`` McCain writes of her own discomfort inside her father 's campaign .
She discloses feelings bordering on pettiness regarding interactions with the Palin family .
`` I felt a joke in the air , but it was on me '' McCain summarized an encounter in a Republican convention makeup room .
`` All the chairs were taken .
The stylists were busy with the Palin kids , as well as Levi .
` Can you make time for me ? . '
I asked . ''
` You 'll have to wait , ' the makeup artist replied .
Levi , Bristol , Willow , and Piper , who was seven , needed to be styled first ` They 'll be getting more airtime . '
`` Meghan McCain also tees off on the Republican Party and her own image .
`` The children of politicians have a surreal life and -LRB- it 's -RRB- time somebody started talking about it , '' McCain wrote .
Meghan McCain details her departure from the day-to-day campaign , `` The campaign finally made its mind up about me : Do n't come back .
I was a distraction , too controversial , and not playing well with others .
