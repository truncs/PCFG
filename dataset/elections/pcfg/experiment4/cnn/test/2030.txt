Despite a roughly nine percent rate of employment in the U.S. , Barack Obama 's job approval rating is at 55 % .

U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to `` win the future '' this week , while moving ahead in the effort to do that himself as well .
Obama delivered the State of the Union address , an annual constitutional obligation which has become an opportunity for the White House to praise its accomplishments and sketch-out its plans .
In that ritual speech to lawmakers , judges , ambassadors and guests , Obama advanced a range of initiatives but passed-over one crucial item on his personal agenda : beginning his campaign for re-election .
Americans voted just a few months ago in Congressional elections that punished Obama 's Democratic Party .
His own job will be on the line the next time they go to the polls , in November of 2012 .
Despite the severe ` shellacking ' that even he concedes he suffered in the November , his prospects are now looking up .
With the American economy continuing to recover from recession and unemployment slowly reducing , Obama is rising in public opinion polls .
In some respects , he 's doing better than even some of his supporters say they 'd expect .
`` Right now , you have the president with 55 percent job approval at nine percent unemployment , which is quite frankly fairly remarkable , '' said Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher .
`` The policies are working and I think the Americans are feeling it . ''
Obama has started staffing his re-election headquarters in his hometown , Chicago , and has shuffled his White House staff as well .
His potential Republican opponents are n't moving quite as fast .
Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin continues to be the most prominent potential figure in the race , but she has n't said publicly whether she 'll run .
Recent public opinion polls put Obama ahead of her and every other potential candidate the Republicans are likely to put forward .
But the race has n't really begun and it promises to challenge the president .
Republicans now control the House of Representatives and are planning a series of confrontations over the Obama administration 's policies and practices .
Unemployment is still high and government spending is still setting records .
Both are serious problems for Obama 's prospects .
`` He 's not a new president anymore , '' said former Republican White House aide Ari Fleischer .
`` It 's time to judge him on results . ''
Americans seem to be doing that and increasingly , they are once again rallying behind Barack Obama .
