Mitt Romney will travel to Pennsylvania Thursday on the same day as President Obama in a political move to hit the president over his handling of the economy and a clear symbolic step as the frontrunner in the GOP presidential field .
Romney 's visit is the latest in a string of attacks on the president 's economic record as the Republican candidate highlights his entrepreneurial past .
A new web video released Thursday from the campaign quotes Obama from his 2009 stop at the plant followed by local media reports on its closing .
The 40-second spot details the economic situation in the presidential swing state , including the over 470,000 unemployed residents and ends with his oft-used tag line , `` Obama is n't working . ''
`` Two and a half years ago , President Obama said that if he did n't get the economy back on track , then he would be a one-term president .
He is right , '' Romney said in a statement .
`` Pennsylvanians have run out of patience .
`` The Democratic National Committee hit back at Romney for his `` failed leadership '' while governor of Massachusetts .
`` As a candidate , Romney has double downed on the failed economic policies that brought us to the brink of a second Great Depression , '' a release from the DNC said .
In a DNC conference call with reporters Thursday , former Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania said the Romney event was a `` cheap shot '' and that the plant 's closing was unrelated to the president 's policies .
The president was in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania last week and Philadelphia on April 6 .
According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll , 48 percent of voters in the state approve of Obama 's performance as president and 48 percent disapprove .
He won the politically important state in the 2008 presidential election with 55 percent of the vote to GOP candidate Sen. John McCain 's 44 percent .
Former President George W. Bush lost the state 's 21 electoral votes in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections , to former Vice President Al Gore with 50 percent in 2000 and Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts with 51 percent of the vote in 2004 .
However , 2010 was a good year for Pennsylvania Republicans .
Republican Pat Toomey won election to the Senate and voters ousted four incumbent House Democrats .
