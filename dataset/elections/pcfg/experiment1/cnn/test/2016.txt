The headlines from most presidential debates usually center on who said what or who came under attack .
But the headline from the first Republican presidential debate of the 2012 election cycle may well end up being who was n't there .
The five men on the stage in Greenville : Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania , Rep. Ron Paul of Texas , former Godfathers Pizza CEO and radio talk show host Herman Cain and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson .
A more impressive list may be who 's not attending .
Among the probable presidential candidates not coming to Greenville are former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels , former U.S. Ambassador to China and former Utah Gov. John Huntsman , and Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota wo n't be there either , but they have n't decided yet on whether they 'll run for their party 's presidential nomination .
It 's the same story for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who appears near or at the top of most of the early 2012 GOP horserace polls , but who has n't decided yet on whether he 'll make another bid for the White House .
Add Donald Trump to the list .
The billionaire businessman , real estate mogul and reality TV star says he 'll decide by June if he 's going to launch a presidential campaign .
And Sarah Palin wo n't be there either .
The former Alaska governor and the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee has not taken any serious steps towards running for the White House , but she has n't ruled out a run .
Other than Paul , who cracks double digits in some of the national horserace polls , the rest of the contenders at the debate are all in the single digits .
And other than Pawlenty , and to a lesser degree Santorum , none of have put together a strong team of advisers and foot soldiers in the early primary states .
Pawlenty , in an op-ed in the Daily Caller Thursday , says the reason some candidates are skipping the event is because `` they believe it 's ` too soon ' to begin the presidential campaign against Barack Obama .
I only hope that it 's not too late .
`` He may be right , or he may be off by a few weeks or months .
The reason there will only be five candidates , and none with a ton of star power , on the stage : The field is still not set .
Only Johnson has formally declared himself a candidate for president .
Until Daniels , Huntsman , Huckabee and Trump decide their intentions , the field wo n't be defined .
