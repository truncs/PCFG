In Mitt Romney 's case , it appears to be all about `` location , location , location . ''
`` Republicans in the Granite State have been closely watching Gov. Romney for 10 years since he was elected in Massachusetts in 2002 .
He needs to win in a state where voters know him best , '' says Rich Galen , a Republican strategist who advised Fred Thompson during his 2008 GOP presidential bid , and who is the author of Mullings.com , an on-line column .
Romney is well known in New Hampshire .
As Galen notes , Romney was governor of neighboring Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007 , is seen often on TV in New Hampshire , he has a vacation home in the state 's ` lakes region ' and he spent lots of time in the state in 2007 and 2008 in his first bid for the White House and last year as well , when he lent a helping hand to New Hampshire Republicans in the midterm election campaign .
The strong name recognition and his past efforts in the state are most likely one reason why Romney 's far ahead of the rest of the field in a CNN\/WMUR poll .
The survey , conducted by the University of New Hampshire and released Monday , indicates that 33 percent of probable GOP primary voters in New Hampshire back Romney , with Rep. Ron Paul of Texas a distant second at nine percent .
`` The shifting nature of the Republican field and a perception that the ` perfect candidate ' candidate has not appeared , has led many New Hampshire Republicans to support the best known candidate , Mitt Romney , '' says Andrew Smith , Director of the UNH Survey Center .
`` Romney has been the clear favorite among New Hampshire Republicans for more than two years and no other candidate has persuaded voters to move away from Romney .
`` The poll also indicates that a desire by New Hampshire Republicans to pick someone who can beat President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election may be behind his poll numbers .
`` Republicans are looking for someone who can take on President Obama , and right now , Romney is seen as the only Republican who can do that , '' adds Smith .
Romney on Friday makes his first visit to Iowa this cycle , with three stops across the state that kicks off the presidential primary and caucus calendar .
And last weekend Romney made his first stop in South Carolina , the first southern state to vote in the road for the White House .
In his 2008 bid , Romney tried to be a player in Iowa and New Hampshire , but the strategy did n't succeed .
He lost in Iowa to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and to Sen.
