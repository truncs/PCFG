Even John McCain and Sarah Palin are given stage time , with actors portraying the losing Republican candidates and belting out songs on their behalf .
In all , 30 singers , actors and dancers are to perform in the musical `` Hope the Obama Musical Story '' when it opens at the Jahrhunderthalle concert hall in Frankfurt in a bilingual mix of English and German .
The audience may recognize that many songs quote from the politicians ' stump speeches during the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign .
The venue for the premiere seems appropriate since the optimism of Obamania remains largely intact in Germany , about a year after Obama , an accomplished public speaker , became America 's first black president .
One campaign highlight was a July 2008 speech to some 200,000 people in the heart of Berlin about the world , the U.S. and its place in it .
On Wednesday , the `` Hope '' performers were still working at their kicks on a small rehearsal stage in an industrial zone of the southwestern city of Karlsruhe .
`` We are rehearsing every day for 12 hours now , '' Jimmie Wilson , who plays Obama , said in a telephone interview .
`` After the opening , we have to see what the feedback is like and then we 'll go on tour .
`` The American once acted in Michael Jackson 's musical `` Sisterella .
`` The organizers of `` Hope ! . ''
said that tickets are only available for the opening night in Frankfurt and that further performances there and in other German cities were still being planned .
`` I had the idea during the presidential campaign .
It was fascinating and the mood at the time fired my imagination , '' American writer Randall Hitchins said in a news release provided by the organizers .
`` All the people were hoping for a change for a better life and there was such a great , collective emotion .
`` While Hitchins initially only wanted to compose one song with the title `` Yes , we can '' in reference to Obama 's campaign slogan he soon realized that the theme had the potential for more .
He teamed up with producer Roberto Emmanuele , a German-Italian , and together they created the musical , which combines different musical styles , from pop , soul and gospel to hip hop and rock .
Set in Obama 's hometown of Chicago and viewed through the eyes of people who share an apartment , the musical tries to show how Obama 's campaign gave people at the time hope for change and belief in a better future .
`` The story starts 20 years ago , when Obama worked as a community organizer in Chicago , and leads all the way to the 2008 campaign , '' said Wilson .
