Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine said Tuesday he is running for the U.S. Senate , leaving an opening at the central committee as the party prepares for President Obama 's re-election bid .
`` I 'm running for the United States Senate because America has big challenges and I 'm convinced that Virginia has answers to help strengthen our nation , '' the former Virginia governor said in an online video .
The video never mentions his tenure at the partisan DNC and he appeals to work across party lines .
`` While we still have an awful lot of work to do to help Virginians who are struggling in tough times , I know that Washington can learn a few things from Virginia .
When we attack common obstacles -- instead of each other -- we solve problems and get things done , '' Kaine said .
Kaine would enter the race to succeed Democratic Sen. Jim Webb , who announced he was retiring from office after just one term .
Kaine has mulled a Senate run in recent weeks and had given strong signs he would mount a Senate campaign .
His candidacy leaves an opening for a DNC chairman to oversee the central party as Obama heads toward a re-election bid .
The DNC also would have to help the party defend a majority in the U.S. Senate and fight to reclaim power in the U.S. House .
Among those under consideration to replace Kaine at as Democratic National Committee chairman are former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland , Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin .
Party officials are weighing who would be the best surrogate for the president as he embarks on his re-election campaign .
Both Strickland and Wasserman Schultz hail from all-important presidential battlegrounds , while Durbin is a close confidant of the president .
Kaine , who won election as governor in 2005 , was among the first elected officials to back Obama 's primary bid .
Obama named him the DNC post and has nudged Kaine toward a run .
Last week , he said Kaine was `` not just a leader for Virginia ; he 's a leader for America .
`` On the Republican side , two former governors are competing for the nomination .
Republican George Allen , who lost the Senate seat to Webb in 2006 and was governor from 1994 to 1998 , announced his candidacy earlier this year .
He faces opposition for the nomination from tea party activist Jamie Radtke .
Allen was a strong 2008 presidential contender until a series of blunders derailed his Senate race and Webb won by just 9,000 votes .
