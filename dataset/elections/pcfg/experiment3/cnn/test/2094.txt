`` STORY HIGHLIGHTS Angle tells Nevada voters , `` the future of the nation rides on us `` She is locked in a tight race with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Reid has been a politician for decades Las Vegas , Nevada -- Nevada Republican Senate nominee Sharron Angle on Friday night declared `` there is going to be shock and awe in Washington '' after the election .
During a rare appearance open to the media , Angle also mocked one of President Obama 's phrases , promising `` we 're going to have a teachable moment . ''
The woman who could unseat the Senate 's top Democrat vowed that conservatives will demand that Congress use its lame duck session to repeal health care reform , which she called `` Obamacare , '' and permanently extend the Bush tax cuts .
The event was a get-out-the-vote rally with Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , talk show host Michael Reagan and actor Jon Voight .
`` The future of the nation rides on us , Nevada , '' she told a crowd of roughly 500 supporters .
`` This is an election of contrasts .
We have a choice this election . ''

She continued , `` I live in a middle class neighborhood in Reno , Nevada .
Harry Reid lives in the Ritz Carlton in Washington , D.C. `` In Nevada , Reid has a modest home in the tiny town of Searchlight .
After noting the state has the highest unemployment and foreclosure rates nationwide , she repeated her debate night one-liner : `` It is time to tell Harry Reid -- time to man up and fix this economy . ''
The crowd chanted , `` Dump Harry Reid . ''
She used the line to make a dig about Social Security , saying Reid should `` man up and admit there is a problem '' with the program 's solvency .
The candidates have tussled for weeks over Social Security .
Reid has consistently argued that the program is financially stable and accuses his opponent of demagoguing the issue to frighten seniors .
The candidate introduced McCain as someone who did `` man up . ''
McCain told the audience that come Election Day , `` we are going to kick Harry Reid out of his penthouse at the Ritz Carlton and send him back to Searchlight . ''
It was an ironic moment because McCain was criticized for owning multiple properties , some of them luxurious , during his 2008 presidential bid .
`` This election will change America , '' he said .
`` The world is watching this election .
