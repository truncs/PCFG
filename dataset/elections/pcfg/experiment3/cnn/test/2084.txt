During the Obama administration 's review of its Afghan policy , Vice President Joseph Biden was a fierce advocate for a narrowly focused counterterrorism strategy .
He had long been skeptical of the more expansive counterinsurgency approach with 30,000 additional troops ultimately decided upon by the president , arguing that pursuing al Qaeda targets in Pakistan and on the Afghan border was a smarter way to go .
Like any good second-in-command who has been overruled , Biden got on board with the president 's new direction .
Still , he has been openly critical of Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's lackluster efforts to tackle corruption and has questioned his credibility as a partner .
In November , after the bloodiest year of the nearly decade-long war in Afghanistan , NATO allies agreed in Lisbon that Afghan forces would start taking over parts of the country this year , with Afghanistan 's entire territory coming under Afghan security control at the end of 2014 .
Biden was firm that the new deadline was not open-ended .
`` We 're starting this process , just like we did in Iraq , '' Biden told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' last month .
`` We 're starting it in July of 2011 , and we 're going to be totally out of there come hell or high water by 2014 . ''
But now Biden seems to be singing a different tune .
Standing next to Karzai in Kabul , Biden assured his Afghan host that United States would remain in Afghanistan beyond the 2014 handover deadline if the Afghans want them to stay .
`` Hopefully , we will have totally turned over the ability to the Afghan security forces to maintain the security of the country , '' Biden said .
`` But we are not leaving if you do n't want us to leave . ''
So did Biden , and the administration at large , change its tune ? .
Because of Biden 's comments last month , it 's easy to view the comments as a shift .
But several senior U.S. officials explained that Biden was talking about the `` enduring partnership '' President Barack Obama has spoken of , promising to maintain ongoing cooperation with the Afghan military beyond 2014 , not only on civilian issues such as governance and economic development , but also on security , including training of the Afghan army and policy and counterterrorism training and assistance .
Even during the NATO summit in Lisbon , U.S. officials were quick to say that the transition to the Afghan army was `` conditions-based '' and held out the possibly that some troops could remain past 2014 .
Iraq , for example , took full responsibility for its security last summer but U.S. troops remain , even though they are on schedule for a full withdrawal by the end of this year .
