Today 's featured district is : Florida 's 22nd district will be the site of one of many political rematches in 2010 , as Democratic Rep. Ron Klein faces off against his 2008 GOP opponent , Allen West .
Klein , currently serving his second term , was first elected in 2006 after unseating 13-term GOP incumbent Clay Shaw .
He has been a loyal Democratic vote in Congress , supporting major Democratic policy initiatives such as health care reform and the economic stimulus plan .
Those votes have led former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin , who is backing West , to describe Klein as a `` left-wing ideologue who 's marched to the beat of Nancy Pelosi .
`` West , a retired Army lieutenant colonel , served in Iraq in both Operation Desert Storm in the 1990s and the more recent Operation Iraqi Freedom .
He has also worked in Afghanistan training Afghan officers .
Klein defeated West in the 2008 general election , winning 55 percent to West 's 45 percent .
If elected this year , West would likely be the only African American Republican in the U.S. House .
The Klein campaign aired the first ad of the general election shortly after polls had closed on Primary Day last Tuesday .
The spot raised questions about West 's personal finances and said he has the `` wrong values for South Florida . ''
West stayed positive in his first general election spot , which did not mention Klein and instead prominently featured children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance .
Unlike in 2008 , West has been very competitive in terms of campaign cash .
By early August , he had raised an impressive $ 4 million , compared to $ 2.5 million for Klein .
But the two nominees were on more equal footing in terms of cash-on-hand .
Klein had $ 2.8 million in the bank at the start of the month , compared to $ 2.2 million for West .
The 22nd district is located in South Florida and covers most of Palm Beach and Broward counties ' Atlantic coastlines .
The district is home to ritzy hotels and shopping centers and relies heavily on the tourism industry .
Although its residents are mostly well-off , they are not immune to the economic climate , and Florida 's high 11.5 unemployment rate should give the incumbent cause for concern .
The district voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the last five election cycles .
