'I won't close the door that perhaps could be open for me in the future,' former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said in an interview that aired Sunday. - Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin says she would consider a run for president in 2012 if the situation was right for her family and the nation.In an interview recorded Saturday and broadcast on "FOX News Sunday," Palin said she would run "if I believed that that is the right thing to do for our country and for the Palin family.""I think that it would be absurd to not consider what it is that I can potentially do to help our country," Palin said, later adding: "I won't close the door that perhaps could be open for me in the future.""It's so inspiring to see real people - not politicos, inside-the-beltway professionals - come out, stand up and speak out for common sense conservative principles," Palin said in her speech to a crowd that gave her repeated standing ovations.Calling the Tea Party movement a "ground-up call to action that is forcing both parties to change the way they're doing business," Palin said "America is ready for another revolution and you are a part of this."In the interview with Fox, Palin said she believed President Barack Obama would lose a re-election bid in 2012 if he fails to change the policies followed so far in just over a year in office.If Obama "continues on the path that he has American on today," Palin said, "he's not going to win."That's what a lot of Americans are telling him today, and he's not listening," Palin said. "Instead, he's telling everybody else, 'Listen up and I'll tell you the way it is.' Well, we have a representative form of government in our democracy. And we want him and we want Congress to listen to what the things are that we are saying."In her speech, Palin cited the upset victory by Republican Scott Brown in the Massachusetts special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by liberal Democrat Ted Kennedy as evidence of the popular discontent over Obama's policies.She called on the administration to take note of the election results, saying "you better stop lecturing and start listening.""The Obama/Pelosi/Reid agenda will leave us less secure, more in debt and under the thumb of big government," Palin said in reference to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.Many of those attending the convention at Nashville's Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center said they are big Palin supporters.
