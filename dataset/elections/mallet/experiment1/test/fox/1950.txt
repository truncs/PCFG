The political art form of when and how to announce a presidential campaign is a delicate, but important decision. Some candidates choose to do it with an internet video, others do television shows or rallies, and some want to be the first, while others prefer to be the last. But no matter how they do it, every detail is dissected, trying to avoid any misstep and make sure the campaign picks the right TV show, the right location with the perfect backdrop and that the candidate is wearing just the right suit color.AEHQ wanted to get some analysis from our own Campaign Carl, putting this year's timetable in perspective to previous ones and seeing what's at stake in how a candidate chooses to make his or her launch for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.The political world is watching and waiting for 2012 hopefuls to jump in with the possibility that Thursday former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich would make his announcement in Atlanta. However, mixed messages from his campaign left more questions than answers with Gingrich pretty much just whispering his presidential exploration instead of shouting his formal plans.Herman Cain, Republican Godfather pizza business man is the only candidate who has expressed his interest in running so far.By this time last campaign cycle, nearly 20 had candidates had publicly already stated their plans and several were in full-campaign mode. Why have Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mitt Romney all waited to make their plans known?.Let's have Campaign Carl break it all down for us.AEHQ: Why is it important when and how candidates decide to launch a campaign?.CARL: First off, by the time a candidate files federal paperwork forming a "Presidential Exploratory Committee"  they have already gauged the level of interest and cash they can expect to receive through early visits to key states, meetings, private polls, phone calls and more. The formation of an exploratory is their first informed signal and a commitment to go forward based on that invisible period of gauging the earliest glimmers of hope.Becoming an early explorer wins attention and alerts voters that a hopefuls' efforts are escalating and will need more support. But it also invites more scrutiny and often triggers the first salvo of attacks from potential rivals and interest groups with divergent views. Waiting too long can be interpreted as indecision, lack of fire in the belly or insufficient positive feedback from key constituencies to move ahead.
