President Barack Obama prepared to head for Massachusetts on Sunday to campaign for the Democratic candidate in a surprisingly close Senate race to fill the seat of longtime liberal lion Ted Kennedy.Republican state Sen. Scott Brown has surged in recent weeks to catch Democratic state Attorney General Martha Coakley, worrying Obama and Democrats about the possibility of losing what once was considered among their safest seats in the nation.A GOP victory in the overwhelmingly Democratic state could give Senate Republicans enough votes to block Obama's health care plan. It could also shatter assumptions about the competitiveness of politics in the progressive northeast.No Republican has a won a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts since 1972. The state's entire congressional delegation is Democratic. Obama beat Sen. John McCain in Massachusetts last year's presidential race by 26 points.Kennedy - an advocate for liberal health care reform throughout his career - held his seat for over 46 years. His brother, President John F. Kennedy, held it for another eight before then.Two well-respected non-partisan national political analysts, Charlie Cook and Stuart Rothenberg, have rated the race a tossup.That is good news for Republicans, who are calling the race a referendum on a national health care bill being pushed through Congress by Obama and Democratic leaders.If Brown pulls an upset and defeats Coakley, the Democrats will lose their 60-seat filibuster-proof coalition in the Senate. The shift could severely threaten the party's priorities on health care and a range of other issues. Brown has promised to vote against the health care bill if elected."It's extremely close in the most liberal, the bluest state in America," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said on "FOX News Sunday."Even if Coakley wins to allow the Democrats to pass the health care bill with their 60-seat filibuster proof Senate majority, the close race shows that most Americans dislike the legislation and want to see it defeated, McConnell said."I think the politics are toxic for the government either way," McConnell said of the health care bill. "Either way, whether it passes or it fails, it will be a huge issue not just in 2010 but in 2012."Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin, a Democrat, said this week that certifying Tuesday's election results could take more than two weeks - potentially enough time to allow congressional Democrats time to pass a final health care bill before Brown is seated.Republicans blasted the timetable, accusing Democrats of trying to stifle the will of the voters. On Sunday, McConnell refused to speculate on a timetable, saying the election winner should be properly sworn in to reflect the will of the people.
