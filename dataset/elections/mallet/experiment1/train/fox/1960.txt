After Tuesday's historic election, the Tea Party may be just getting started.More than 30 Tea Party-supported candidates seized victory on Tuesday as Republicans captured the House and diminished the Democratic majority in the Senate. Among the winners in the Senate were Rand Paul in Kentucky, Marco Rubio in Florida, Mike Lee in Utah and Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania.But anything could happen from now until the presidential election in 2012, and it remains to be seen whether a movement that prides itself on being outside the establishment will front its own Tea Party presidential candidate, revolutionize the Republican Party or merely fade back into the background.Leading Tea Partiers vowed to keep up the pressure on their favored new lawmakers to fight a Washington establishment they say is broken and doesn't work for the best interests of the American people. That could make trouble for congressional leaders who need compromise and dealmaking to get any work done.Several Tea Party winners said in interviews that they were reaching out to one another in the wake of the elections to form a coalition based on their conservative principles. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., had formed a Tea Party caucus this summer with a couple dozen members, but it's unclear whether freshmen lawmakers with Tea Party backing would join her group or start one of their own.A spokesman for Bachmann told FoxNews.com that her caucus has 52 members, and they are expecting "a huge boost when the new Congress meets." One aim is to prevent Tea Party members of Congress from getting "co-opted by the establishment."Tea Party leaders face a similar choice: establish their own political party or work within the Republican Party at the risk of being co-opted or touching off clashes.As a third party, the Tea Party would have to hold separate primaries, maximize money sources and present a field of candidates on a stated platform.Staying on the fringe of the GOP could pose more of the same problems it did in the 2010 election cycle, when some Tea Party candidates won Republican nominations but failed to prevail in general elections that establishment Republicans had been favored to win.For example, the Tea Party movement failed to bring down its biggest target, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who beat Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle. Other Tea Party losers were Christine O'Donnell in Delaware's Senate race, Ken Buck in Colorado's Senate race, and Carl Paladino in the New York governor's race.
